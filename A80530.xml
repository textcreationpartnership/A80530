         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it pleaſe you, who are called by the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Powers,</hi> both in Heaven and Earth, to bring into the light, <hi>abſcondita te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrarum,</hi> the hidden things of darkneſſe; to caſt your eys down upon the ground, where you
<pb facs="tcp:152599:3"/> ſhall finde, lying in a corner, a pooreman toſſed by the courſe of the World, from Darkneſſe to Obſcurity. There is nothing more eminent, and more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in God, than his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: And therefore, no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are more glorious than the inſtruments which hee employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſetting forth, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it. I had great reaſon to feare, becauſe through all the chances and changes of my life, ſome kinds of darkneſſe did ſtill haunt me, that I ſhould never have appeared in the perfect light, till I ſhould have come to the light of Heaven: But anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the reflexion of your countenance, I ſhall have better
<pb facs="tcp:152599:3"/> hopes. O yee good, and great Proteſtors againſt the pride and prophaneneſſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Ponder, I moſt humbly beſeech you, the mayn things that I have learned from the mouthes of <hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, where every man ſpeaks freely; which in part, are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that their number in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is ſo great, and the Houſes of all Papiſts, who are able to goe under the burden, ſo ful, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but with much hardnes, live by one another. And it muſt needs be ſo: For, the man is of little account amongſt them, that will not mayntaine a Prieſt; and many receive many.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152599:4"/>
            <p>Secondly, That they convey many thouſands of pounds eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeare, to their Houſes. For, the Bodies reſident in their Houſes are ſuch, that the parts are either all <hi>homogeneous,</hi> and of the ſame kinde; as, all <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> all <hi>Monks,</hi> all <hi>Friars;</hi> and theſe have great Reliefe ſent them from <hi>England:</hi> or <hi>heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,</hi> and of a different kind; as <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> and <hi>Scholers;</hi> and theſe are ſuſtained by Lands, or by Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; where the <hi>Scholers</hi> are ſet apart for <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> as in <hi>Rome, Sevill, Valladolid:</hi> to other places, as to their <hi>Colledges,</hi> of Saint <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> and <hi>Doway,</hi> a very great part of their meanes, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, comes out of <hi>England.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:152599:4"/> And that, for this purpoſe, and the ſafe paſſage of their Goers and Commers, young and old, the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are <hi>Maſters</hi> of a <hi>Ship,</hi> furniſhed with many kinds of Colours, and many ſorts of Countrimen, in which Ship, I my ſelfe ſhould have paſſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that baniſhed out of <hi>England,</hi> going from one Port, they muſt preſently return to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: becauſe their <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath not leave from the <hi>Pope,</hi> to apply it ſelfe to action, and exerciſe, but in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> (and ſo their Faculties run:) And their places of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in other Countries are loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152599:5"/>
            <p>Fourthly, that they win ſouls to them, every day in <hi>England,</hi> and almoſt, in all parts of it: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping greatly, to undermine us by little and little; and grow up (wee not minding them) to the greater number. Wherefore, they are ſtrangely cunning in their carriages; taking the ſhapes of Phyſicians, that in a more covert manner, they may viſit the ſick: (which as the generall voice goes, was acted in my poore pariſh, a little before I came to it; and the effect was, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died a papiſt, who had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a proteſtant; and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſoon after, made a papiſt, and rewarded by a great perſon, with a ſervice:) And the habits
<pb facs="tcp:152599:5"/> of Beggars, Souldiers, Captains; and of Countrymen, bearing long ſtaves upon their necks: And they will be Servingmen too, if occaſion give way. And there is ſcarce a Houſe, that looks like a Houſe, which they have not fitted with private doores and conveyances.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> have two Houſes in <hi>England;</hi> one in <hi>London,</hi> known to them, by the name of Saint <hi>Ignatius:</hi> another in the Country, called, Saint <hi>Xaverius</hi> his Houſe. And that both the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, Monks,</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Novices, which have wore their Habits, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their Novice-ſhips, even in <hi>England.</hi> And that the Biſhop of
<pb facs="tcp:152599:6"/> 
               <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in the time of his abode heere, ordained <hi>Prieſts.</hi> And that they are, or have bin furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſecret preſſes under ground, for the printing of Books.</p>
            <p>Thus farre, in the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, I doe charge the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts of <hi>England;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truly, faithfully, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly brought them, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt themſelves. And if men may be judged out of their own mouthes (as one was jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<note place="margin">Serve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, ex tuo ipſius ore judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris.</note> by the Iudge himſelfe,) they may be likewiſe accuſed out of their owne mouthes: becauſe right judgement proceedeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to juſt accuſation. And when men of theſe darke ways,
<pb facs="tcp:152599:6"/> men of pragmaticall, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heads are alſo bold, what will they not dare to endeavour? What will they leave unattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? And are they not very bold, when <hi>Franciſcus à ſancta Clara,</hi> a man of a holy name, becauſe hee named himſelf, but a ſubtil one, and of my old acquaintance, durſt vent the relikes of his old Dictates in a forme, bending us, and the profeſſion of our Faith, by which we are entitled to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to a Reconciliation with them? And this being done, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mee, almoſt to my owne doores, in the Country; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving took his ſtanding in a great Houſe, neer me, give matter, and heart to his evill Inſtruments, to
<pb facs="tcp:152599:7"/> diſhonour me, and make a ſport and ſcorne of mee, in my own Pariſh, and within my owne ſmall fold? Are they not unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably bold, when a Prieſt came to my Lodging, and there, in his fury, attempted to draw a ſword upon me? If you graciouſly aſſiſt me not, I have bin ſaved abroad, to periſh at home, with all my friends about me: or at leaſt, to lie buried in ſecrecie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Pardon me, if I am hot. I have bin hitherto chill: and lukewarmneſſe is highly blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I have bin wrought upon, through all my life; and bowed to ſerve other mens ends: And have ignorantly ſuffered my ſelfe to be moved, and faſhioned in
<pb facs="tcp:152599:7"/> order to them. But now the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard is off, I will throw them off, one here, and one there; and only ſerve God, who is my true end. It is remarkable, that the Papiſts turn our lenity, and gentleneſſe towards them, into an argument againſt us: inferring that wee have no zeale, no religion. O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the flocks and multitudes of ignorant people, that came to me, when I lodged in <hi>London,</hi> crying for ſatisfaction in matters of beliefe: Every one of them, being divided betwixt a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and a Papiſt; &amp; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where to finde reſt for their ſouls. And ſome came under my hands, whom the papiſts, by their continual perſwaſions, had
<pb facs="tcp:152599:8"/> wrought into a diſtraction; ſome into madnes. This others know, with mee. God will require an account of theſe ſouls. O that it were granted to mee, but firſt to the glory of God, that while I have leave to behold this good light, both of the Sun, and of the Goſpell, I might ſpeake in the light, (as our Saviour commands us) what I have heard in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! and that I might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand, to binde up the gaping wounds of afflicted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; even where they are moſt wounded, becauſe there are moſt Enemies. <hi>Neither do men,</hi> ſaith<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 15.</note> our Saviour, <hi>light a candle, and put it under a buſhell: but on a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick, and it giveth light to all
<pb facs="tcp:152599:8"/> that are in the Houſe.</hi> The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick is the place of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; be it ſmall or great. Shall the zeale of the true Church, be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome in religious forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by a falſe one? It is not all my purpoſe, to labour in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Popery. Part of it is, to teach plainly and truly, the Faith profeſſed in <hi>England;</hi> and the piety of a Chriſtian life, even to the perfection of it; as will appeare to the Reader. It is our Saviours Rule, commended to Saint <hi>Peter, When thou art conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32.</note> 
               <hi>ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi> God hath abundantly performed his part towards mee: the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of my part remaineth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and my Brethren.
<pb facs="tcp:152599:9"/> And no zeale is like to <hi>zelus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum,</hi> the zeal of ſouls. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuits, which the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſaid to the Spouſe: <hi>My</hi>

               <hi>beloved ſpake, and ſaid unto mee, Riſe up, my love, my faire one, and come away: For loe, the winter is paſt, the rain is over, and gone. The flowers appeare on the earth, the time of the ſinging of birds is come, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in our land. The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape, give a good ſmell.

                     </gap>h comes from the Holy Ghoſt. I will bee ſure to tell truth: and upon this ground, truth being told, every man may be ſure from whom it comes; &amp; fix upon it in the deduction of the Concluſions, it virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly containeth; as upon the firm Principles of a Science. I am not ignorant, that ſometimes it is a ſin to ſpeak truth: becauſe there may be a falſhood committed, though not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: as a falſe breach of true Charity, which many times obligeth to ſecrecie. And theſe times, the ſpeaking of truth, is indeed a lie;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152599:11"/> becauſe ſuch a ſin, and againſt God, who is Truth, even as he is Truth. But I know it for a Maxime: Againſt a publique enemie of the Church of God, we may lawfully and religiouſly ſpeak all Truths. It is a rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Caſuiſts: <hi>Certa pro certis habenda; dubia ut dubia ſunt proponenda:</hi> in a Relation, certain things are to be propoſed as things certain, and doubtfull, as doubtfull. Let no man doubt, but I will certainly dreſſe every thing in cloathes according to its degree.</p>
                  <p>Hence followes a leſſon, and it falles within my leſſon. God was in all eternity, till the beginning of the World; and but one word came from him, and that a good one, as good as himſelfe: and not ſpoken, but as it were, onely conceived. Words are not to bee thought raſhly; and if not to bee thought, not to he ſpoken; becauſe we think not in the ſight of our neighbours; but we ſpeak in the hearing of our neighbours: and if not to be ſpoken, not to be written; becauſe we write with more deliberation and more expence of precious Time; and words are more laſting, when they are written. I will heare what Chriſt ſays to his Church, in the <hi>Canticles, Thy lipps are like a thread of Scarlet, and thy ſpeech is comely.</hi> Saint<note place="margin">Can. 4. 3.</note>

It is in the reading of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books, as in the hearing of Sermons. If we open our ſhells, our ſoules, the Heavens will drop their dewe into them, the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dewe of Grace: to be imployed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, in making pearles of good works, and ſolid vertue.

Where note, that the Father ſends, but is not ſent; for, miſſion ſuppoſeth in the ſender, at leaſt a kinde of priority: the Sonne is both ſent, and ſends; the holy Ghoſt ſends not, but is ſent. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſired, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> one of their owne company and acquaintance,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152599:16"/> might ſpeak to them. For, God was ſo loud, and terrible in the delivery, that he ſeemed to cruſh, and overwhelme mortality. <hi>Speak thou with us,</hi> (ſaid they to Moſes,) <hi>and wee</hi>

I will ſay ſomething: And yet, I will not ſay it. But if I ſhould ſay it: what can the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay? The Church which gives a miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gives it as ſhe tooke it from Chriſt. As ſhe tooke it from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, ſhe was a pure Church. As ſhee was a pure Church, ſhe gave, and now giveth becauſe ſhe hath beene a pure Church, and received her warrant in her purity; when ſhee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a miſſion, authority to preach againſt all impurity both in faith and manners, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her ſelfe, or elſe-where. And behold, being ſent, I am come. Now, let us anſwer in ſome kinde to Gods kindneſſe. It is one part of wiſedome in a ſerpent, commended, and commended to us, by one who loved us dearely: that going to drink, he cleanſeth every ſecret corner, and dark turning of his mouth, from poyſon. <hi>Be yee wiſe as ſerpents. Moſes</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to put off his ſhooes,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152599:16"/> becauſe it was holy, &amp; conſecrated ground. All terrene thoughts, and earthly affections, bemired with treading deepe in the world.

Almighty God hath indeed, a little good ground in the world: but it is duly and daily weeded &amp; manured; well clear'd from ſtones and briars, before the heavenly ſower comes to work. Here therefore, even here, before we take another ſtep, let us turn the face of all our thoughts towards God, to ſtand like officious, and dutifull ſervants, attending upon the nod, and pleaſure of our great Lord, and Maſter. <hi>Behold, as the eyes of ſervants looke unto the hand of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi>

                  <p>IT is an old Axiome, as old as Philoſophy, <hi>Veritas una, error autem multiplex,</hi> Truth is one, and error manifold. Truth muſt needs be one, becauſe it hath but one firſt origine, and ſuch a one as is moſt conſtant to it ſelfe, and can never be found in two contrary tales. And error muſt needs be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold, becauſe it hath many fountaines, and ſuch as ſeldome mingle their ſtreames, and ſeldome agree wholy in any thing, but in this, that they all erre, and runne beſide the channell. There are many wayes out of the way, and but one true way: as there is but one health, yet many ſickneſſes; but one way to be borne, yet many wayes to dye. And man, ever ſince he firſt erred, is very prone to erre: and having erred, ſtops not in the firſt error; but adds preſently error to errour, by loving, and admiring his owne errour. And errour is not alwayes deſirous to be a neat, and a fine errour, but now and then, it will be groſſe. The ſnow is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly white. Who will ſay, in the hearing of a reaſonable creature, that ſnow is not purely white?

To which if any time be added, it doth not come to remaine with us, but to leave us, and come no more. Thoſe, who lived in the Age before us, our Fathers and Grandfathers, are dead, and turn'd to dirt; and we now in their places: we alſo, muſt ſhortly dye, and turne to dirt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſucceed us; and they likewiſe, muſt take their turne: and thus, we all turne by turnes, one after another, into plaine dirt; and this is the meane, and homely end of all our bravery.

                  <p>VVHat mervaile now, if greene in Age, and ſhallow in experience, I gave up my ſoule, into the black hands of errour? The cauſes of my cloſing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were three. Firſt, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the great ſinnes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and eſpecially, of that open, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and horrible ſinne of Drunkenneſſe; which my ſoule hateth. And I weakly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152599:22"/> from a blemiſh of manners, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, to a generall, and over-ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruption of Faith. My thoughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented a drunkard to me, ſometimes in this manner. What is a Drunkard, but a beaſt like a man, or, ſomething lower then a beaſt? When he is in his fit, no ſenſe will performe his fit office. Spectacles in all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, appeare to him: hee thinks, hee ſees more ſhapes, then God ever made. A cloud ſettles in his eyes; and the whole body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overflowne, they ſeeme to float in the floud. The earth ſeemes to him to nod, and hee nods againe to it; trees to walk in the fields; houſes, to riſe from their places, and leape into the Aire; as if they would tumble upon his head, and cruſh him to a Cake; and therefore, he makes haſt to avoid the danger. The Sea ſeemes to rore in his cares, and the Guns to goe off; and he ſtrives to rore as loud as they. The Beere begins to work; for, he foames at the mouth. Hee ſpeaks, as if the greater part of his tongue were under water. His tongue labours upon his words: and the ſame word, often repeated, is a ſentence. You may diſcover a foole, in every part of his face. Hee goes like — like what? nothing is vile enough, to ſuit in compariſon with him; except I ſhould ſay, like himſelfe, or like another
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152599:23"/> drunken man. And at every ſlip, he is faine to throw his wandring hand upon any thing; to ſtay him with his body, and face upwards, as God made him. <hi>

And after all this, being reſtored to himſelfe, he forgets, becauſe hee knew not perfectly, what hee was, and next day returnes againe to his vomit. And thus he reeles from the Inn, or Tavern, to his houſe, morning and evening, night and day; till, after all his reeling, not being able to goe, hee is carried out of his Houſe, not into the Taverne, alas, hee cannot call for what hee wants; but into his Grave. Where being layd, and his mouth ſtopt with dirt, hee ceaſes to reele; till at laſt, hee ſhall reele, body and ſoule, into hell: where, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his former plenty, &amp; variety of drinks, hee ſhall never be ſo gracious, as to obtaine a ſmall drop of water, to coole his tongue.

And if it be a firme ground, that, putting our ſelves into the occaſions of ſuch and ſuch ſins, we are as guilty of them, as if wee had committed them; although we did not formally, and explicitely intend them: how many great ſins, hath one act of drunkenneſſe, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for? Drunkenneſſe is moſt hatefull to God, becauſe it putteth out the light of Reaſon, by which, man is diſtinguiſhed from a beaſt, and all better lights with it, and throwes a man beneath Gods creation; and therefore, drunkenneſſe is more or leſſe grievous, as it more or leſſe impeacheth the light and ſight of Reaſon. <hi>Natura paucis contenta,</hi> Nature is contented with a little; <hi>quam ſi ſuperfluis urgere velis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Boetius,</hi> which if you ſhall urge, and load with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous<note place="margin">Boet.</note> things, you will deſtroy.

And Sobriety, and Temperance are faire vertues; which even the Glutton, and Drunkard doe praiſe, and magnifie. If wee turne aſide into the Church-yard, wee ſhall finde it a dry time there. There are no merry meetings under ground; no muſick, no dancing, no ſongs, no jeſting company: Every body ſleepes there, and therefore, there is no noiſe at all. Perhaps indeed, as men paſſe to the Church, or to their places in the Church, they point to ſuch a Grave, and ſay; There lyes a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, hee is ſober enough now; but much againſt his will.

                  <p>MY ſecond Reaſon of joyning hands with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I framed to my ſelfe, the imagination of an excellent Sanctity, and a ſpotleſſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of life, in their Orders of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And my thoughts fed upon this, and the like matter. The laſt end of man, and his Creation, is Bleſſedneſſe; being the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or fruition of God; which is, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sabbath, or, an everlaſting day of reſt, in him. And therefore, the ſoule of man, which bendeth towards this end, chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth reſt. For, God would not, (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid, could not) create man for an end, and not imprint in him, a ſtrong deſire of it. Heavey things, belonging to earth, will not of themſelves move towards Heaven; nor yet, ſtay loytering betwixt Heaven and Earth, unleſſe arreſted, and held by force: but haſte to the center of the world, the earth, their true place of being, in which, and in which onely, they take their naturall

The gentle Dove, before the tumult of waters began to ſettle, could finde no place to ſettle in; no ſure, no ſolid reſt for her foot: and the ſilly thing had not learn'd to ſwim. This tumult of waters in the world, will never end, till the world ends. And therefore, <hi>O that I had wings like a Dove: for then would</hi>

And now, I would faine be flying. And not hanging upon the wing, and hovering over dunghills: but fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. And not flying away, I know not whither; but to the knowne place of reſt: <hi>For then would I flie away, and be at reſt.</hi> And not wings like a Hawk, or Eagle; to help, and aſſiſt me in the deſtruction of others: but <hi>wings like a Dove;</hi> by which I may ſecure to my ſelfe, the continuance of a quiet, and innocent life. I would looke upon the earth, as God does, from above. I would raiſe my thoughts above the colde, and dampiſh earth; and fly with the white, and harmleſſe Dove, when the fury of the waters began to be aſſwaged, to the top of a high mountaine, the mountaine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation:

It is granted that I am the void, and empty Cave of ignorance; the muddy fountaine of evill concupiſcence; dark in my underſtanding, weake in my will, and very forgetfull of good things: and that, left to my ſelfe, I am not my ſelfe, but a devill in my ſhape.

That, becauſe I playd the Beaſt, in erring againſt the rules of reaſon; beaſts, and unreaſonable creatures of all kindes, ſhould lie every where in wait to deſtroy me: that the Birds of the Aire, ſhould break into my Houſe, catch the bread out of my hand before it comes to my mouth, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away the very meat from my Table; becauſe they deſerve it, better then I: that Spiders ſhould empty their poyſon, into my drink: that becauſe I ſtript my ſoule, and rob'd her of her wedding garment; no kind of garment ſhould ever be able to hang upon my back. I have deſerved, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have infected my Brethren by evill example, the hearts and hands of all men ſhould be turned againſt me; that, as I paſſe in the ſtreets, men and women ſhould laugh at me in ſcorne; and mock me, as they doe fooles &amp; mad men: and that, becauſe I have beene a ſtumbling-block to youth, Boyes and Girles ſhould run after me with a noiſe; and that their Parents, and people of all ſorts, ſhould throw dirt in my face.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152599:31"/> Traveller, who was now in his returne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Country. Having paſſed for an Italian, not only in clothes, but in Country; and being landed at <hi>Calice</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> it hapned, that I travelled from thence to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> with a Jeſuit, and a young Scholler, which he brought with him out of <hi>England:</hi> and they had come in the Ship wherein I paſſed. Hee was apparrelled like a ſecular Gentleman, and wore a little Ponyard by his ſide. And we three mingling diſcourſe, as we journeyed, he told us, that the Pony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard was given him by a Catholike, a deare friend of his; upon a condition, that hee ſhould kil a Purſuivant with it. God knows, I lie not. By a Purſuivant, hee meant one of the Kings Meſſengers, which are imployed in the ſearch, and apprehenſion of Prieſts and Jeſuits. But O my Lord, and my God, can this be the veine, and the ſpirit of the Primitive Church? or, doth it taſte of the meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe of Chriſt our ſweet Saviour, either in his life, or doctrine?

                  <p>IT is the courſe of the Jeſuits at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> to ſend every yeare in the time of Harveſt, two miſſions of Engliſh Schollers, into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the Chriſtian world: one, to <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> And another to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> or <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spaine:</hi> and theſe places in <hi>Spaine,</hi> receive their miſſions by turnes. In all theſe places, are Engliſh Colledges: Whereof the Superiours, or Governours, are Jeſuits: the reſt, Schollers, chalked out for ſecular Prieſts. By ſecular Prieſts I underſtand, not regular Prieſts; neither Jeſuits, nor Monks, nor Friars; but Prieſts, without any farther addition: whoſe primarie charge in their Inſtitution, by which they differ from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is, to teach and inſtruct ſecular peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to reſide in Benefices, and be Pariſh
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152599:33"/> Prieſts. Here, I have a notable trick to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and I ſhall ever ſtop, and ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ponder the malice of the Jeſuits, when I think of it. Their beſt, and moſt able Schollers, they ſend alwayes, to <hi>Spaine:</hi> and onely, their weaker veſſels, to <hi>Rome;</hi> in their ordinarie proceedings: whereof ſome are lame, ſome crooked, others imperfect in the naturall part of ſpeaking. The reaſon of it, is excellent knowledge. The Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers being with them, and ſubordinate to them in their Colledges, and now, far from their Country: it is a great portion of their labour, to win them by favours, promiſes, threats in the by, and much cunning, to be Jeſuits: and ſo, they never leave any (if all they can doe, will doe withall) for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts, but the leane and bony end, and the refuſe of them. For, the Jeſuits and the Secular Prieſts, are great oppoſites; and much contrary in their opinions: and the weaknes of the one wil help negatively, to the ſtrength of the other. The Pope being informed of this Jeſuiticall device, gave a command at <hi>Rome,</hi> where his power is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in all kindes: that every Scholler, the yeare of his probation being expired, ſhould bind himſelfe by an oath, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any order of Religion; till after three yeares durance in <hi>England.</hi> And then,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152599:33"/> they began to ſet on foot the trick I told you of. But, if one deſires admittance into a miſſion, who by reaſon of ſome defect, (for example, the defect of having entred into an order, and returned with diſlike) cannot according to their rules, be a Jeſuit; if hee comes with ſtrong, and able commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will ſend him to <hi>Rome,</hi> though he be a deſerving man; that he, and ſuch as he, may ſtand like a good face, or a freſh colour, over the device, that lyeth inward. They have a very godly-fac'd anſwer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: and ſay; theſe imperfect creatures are as God made them; and they are ſent over by their poore friends, to be Prieſts; and we that weare out our bodies, and lifes in the education of Youth, have good reaſon to chuſe the ſounder part: and they which come to us, are not taken from the Church, but reſtored to it, in a more excellent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But, firſt, according to their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they are bound to goe along with the Founders intention; and the Founder intended the maintenance, for able men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they doe not performe their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Charity towards the body of the Clergie, which they notably maime, and diſable: and yet, in thoſe places they are onely Stewards for the Clergie. Thirdly, they doe great injurie both to their Church,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152599:34"/> and their cauſe; which ſuffereth oftentimes by ſuch Martyrs of Nature, and ſuch unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Defenders: Some of which, cannot read Latine, nor yet hard Engliſh. See how God worketh for us, by their ſins. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they delude the Popes command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the oath, and wholly fruſtrate his purpoſe; and their fourth vow of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Holineſſe, ſtands for a cypher in this buſineſſe. And much more. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth now, but that malice is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the action; and that they make themſelves Gods, and turne all to their owne ends?</p>

                  <p>AT S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Omers,</hi> their manner is, to make triall of every one that comes; what nature, and ſpirit hee is of, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe he hath made in learning; partly by applying ſubtill young Lads to him, which keepe him company, and turne him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and inward againe, and make returne of their obſervations to the Jeſuits: and partly, by their owne ſifting him, either in diſcourſe, or examination, or in ſome other more laboured exerciſe. Which triall when I had undergone, an old Jeſuit, gray in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152599:34"/> and a crafty one, and one, whoſe name you have in your minde, when you think Not, being then Vice-provinciall of the Engliſh Jeſuits, look'd ſoberly upon me, and told me of a ſpirituall exerciſe, in uſe amongſt them, which would much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre me in the ſervice of God, if I was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make uſe of it. I yeelded. And the next day, in the evening, I was brought into a Chamber, where the Curtaines were drawne, and all made very dark; onely, a little light ſtole in at a corner of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to a Table; where ſtood pen, ink, and paper: and order was given me by my ghoſtly Father, a cunning man, a man that did not walk in the light, that I ſhould not undraw the Curtaines, or ſpeak with any perſon but himſelfe, for certaine dayes; and what the ſpirit of God ſhould inſpire into my heart concerning my courſe of life, I ſhould write; there being pen, ink, and paper. And he left a Meditation with mee, the matter of which, was indeed, very heavenly; and hee brought every day two or three more. Hee viſited me two or three times a day; and alwayes, his queſtion was, after, how doe you childe, and ſo forth? What? have you wrot any thing? Feel you not any particular ſtirrings of the ſpirit of God? And alwayes, I anſwered plainely,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152599:35"/> and truly, no. Having beene kept in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſome dayes; and alwayes left to a more ſerious, and attentive liſtning after the holy Ghoſt; and perceiving no ſignes of a releaſement; I began to ſuſpect, what the man aim'd at. And I prayed heartily, that my good God would be pleaſed to direct me. Think with me: Had theſe Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beene appointed meerely, and preciſely for the elevation of my ſoule to God, they had beene excellent: but perverted, and abuſed to ſerve mens ends, they were not what they were. But I thought, I would know farther e're long. The holy man came againe, and ſtill enquired, if I knew the minde of the Holy Ghoſt. My anſwer was: I did hope, yes; but I was loth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe aſhamed, to ſpeak it. Being encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him, I ſaid; That in my laſt Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſpirit of God ſeemed to call me to the Society. Hee knew the phraſe, and the ſenſe of it, was, God moved me to be a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. He preſently, caught up my words, and told me, I was a happy man, and had great cauſe to bleſſe God for ſo high a calling; with much, to that purpoſe. And when he had his end, my Meditations had their end, and the Curtaines were drawne, and having beene enlightned from Heaven, it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that I ſhould enjoy the light of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152599:35"/> world; and there was all the good man look'd for. But, had not the Holy Ghoſt ſpoke as he did, hee would not have beene thought, to ſpeake like the Holy Ghoſt. And now, I was brought downe from my dark Cell, with great joy, and lightſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and all the Boyes were unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent abroad with me that afternoone, to recreate their ſpirits, and be merry with the new-borne childe. Yet afterwards, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance being required of what I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, my heart gave back. For, I had been counſelled by ſome of the leſſe Jeſuited Schollers, to goe in a miſſion, and read far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the practice of the Jeſuits, before I took their habit. Which the Jeſuits labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to prevent, telling me, their numbers in their miſſions were full. I ſtood to it, and gave them no ground; ſaying, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>England,</hi> if I went not: and ſo, they ſent mee in the miſſion, to <hi>Valladolid</hi> in <hi>Spaine.</hi> But I ſaw with both my eyes, they were in good hope, to gaine me afterwards. Many are of opinion, that a great cauſe of theſe great diſturbances in the world, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men walk not in thoſe vocations to which God hath called them. The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vocation is, when a man findes, (after a fit imploring of Gods help) in the due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his heart, that he can beſt, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152599:36"/> moſt proportionably to his abilities, ſerve God in ſuch an honeſt courſe, lying within the reach, and condition of his life. And undoubtedly, theſe foule wayes, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wreſtings of Gods ſpirit. Me thinks now, a man may throughly meditate, every day if he pleaſe, both whence hee came, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee goes, in little <hi>England:</hi> where hee may doe it freely, and ſweetly; and where, in the doing of it, no man will have a plot upon Him, or urge him to exact upon the Holy Ghoſt. And leſt the Jeſuits ſhould imagine, wee are here altogether deſtitute of ſuch helps, and for the benefit of my neighbour, I will ſet downe a Meditation in this kinde: and he ownes it, that deſires with all his heart, to ſerve God with all his might; and by him, they may gueſſe of others.</p>

                     <p>I Will fold my ſelfe inward, and ponder ſeriouſly, what and where I was, ſome few yeares agoe: what and where, before my Father was borne, or, when hee was a childe. If I lay aſide an odde trifle of dayes, if I take away a ſhort courſe of running time, No man or woman now living was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152599:36"/> alive. Creeping things, though they could but creepe, did live, and rejoyce in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable being. And other little creatures had wings, and were able to flie readily, here, there, and here againe; and other wayes, upwards, and downwards. And we, vvho now goe vvith ſuch a grace, and look ſo full-eyde, and build to our ſelves ſuch <hi>Babels</hi> in our imaginations, had no kinde of Being. Theſe Churches, theſe Townes, this Kingdome, this heap of Kingdoms the vvorld, vvere as vvee ſee them: but vvee vvere not heard of, not becauſe vvee vvere a great vvay off, but becauſe vve vvere not. Were not heard, vvere not ſeene, vvere no vvhere, and all, becauſe vve vvere not. <hi>Quae non ſunt, quomodò ambulabunt, aut loquentur?</hi>

Such birds of the ſame colours, did ſing merrily to the ſame tunes; and hop from branch to branch, and flie from tree to tree, as now they doe. Beaſts and Fiſhes, in the ſame, the very ſame diverſity of ſhapes, followed their ſeverall inſtincts of nature. The Bees made honey, that differed nothing from ours, but onely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152599:37"/> becauſe it vvas not the ſame. The vvindes blew cold, and vvarme; and vvarme, and cold againe.

                     <p>O Pretious peeces that we are! we were all, as it were, borne of the Night, and call'd from a dark Nothing. And yet truly, the moſt unworthy, and moſt contemptible matter that is, yea, the Devils, and Damned in Hell, the loweſt in the preſent order of Spirits, are placed many ſteps of vvorth above nothing, as being Gods creatures, and bearing his coliſſons; though branded with the fouleſt marks of diſhonour. For, God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152599:37"/> is honoured, even by the Being, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Diſhonour of the damned; in which, the divine Juſtice triumpheth. But from Nothing, no honour can riſe to him, onely that hee made ſomething of nothing. Nothing is ſo baſe, that for it's meere baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we cannot conceive it: nor ſpeake of it, but in diſgrace, by denying it to be any thing: which neither ſenſe, nor underſtanding can apprehend. It hath no figure, ſhape, or colour: and is no where, becauſe it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It cannot be painted; and though the Devill is painted under the forme of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, yet that cannot: (that? what? nothing:) becauſe it is the meere negation of a thing. O curſed negation! God never made thee. For, had God made thee, thou hadſt beene ſomething. And hadſt thou been any thing, there had beene as many things for ever with God, as things had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by the power of God. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but by ſaying, it is not: and of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we cannot ſay, it is, but by adding, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Of which now thinking, or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or writing; I think, or ſpeak, or write of nothing. And ſo, we being, and yet truly, not truly being, but being nothing, God gave us the noble being we have; and made us Kings, and Queens of all corporal things, when hee might have made us with his left
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152599:38"/> hand, Toads, Vipers, or Snakes: Spiders, to be alwayes watching in catching Flyes, and to weave out our bowells, to fill our bellies: Snails, to paſſe over all our time in creeping, and in our paſſage from place to place, to linger in the way, and wait for our deſtruction: wormes, to be trod to peeces without any pitty, or thought of what is done, or that ſuch a ſtep was the death of a worme: Flyes, to play in the light, and preſently periſh, by day in a Cobweb, by night in a candle: leafes of ſower graſſe, or fading flowers: unworthy peeces of wood, to be carved into any, yea, the vileſt ſhape, or perverted to the baſeſt uſe. Wee might have bin Idols, or Images, ſet up in diſhonor of God, which every one that loves him, would not have been for all the world: or, ſome other inferiour thing, provided for the uſe of man. I wil remember the young-man, that weeping at the ſight of a Toad, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by certaine Biſhops, as they paſſed in the way where he was, the cauſe of his griefe; anſwered, and ſoftned every word with a teare, that he wept, becauſe he had riſen to ſuch a bulk of body, and heigth of yeares, and never yet given thanks to God, for not creating him ſo foule an object of contempt, as the Toad: when hee was to God his Maker, as willing and eaſie clay in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152599:38"/> the hands of the Potter. O Lord, I thank thee for him, and for my ſelfe, and for us all.</p>

Which, leſt it ſhould continually provoke a loathing, he hath changed into a more fine ſubſtance, &amp; covered all over, with a fair, and faſhionable skinne: but with a condition of returning at a word, and halfe a call from Heaven, unto Earth, and into Earth. That, although he might afterwards, be lifted up in the ſcale of his ſoule, hee might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed againe preſently on the other ſide, by the waight, and heavineſſe of his body; and ſo, might lay the deep, and low foundation of humility, requiſite to the high, and ſtately

And God breathed upon his face, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then upon any other part of his body, becauſe all the ſenſes of man doe flouriſh in his face; and becauſe agreeably to his own ordinance, in the face the operations of the ſoule ſhould be moſt apparent, as the ſignes of feare, griefe, joy, and the like, wherefore, one calls the eyes, <gap reason="foreign">

I grant, that God in the beginning, firſt rais'd all things by a ſtrange lift, out of nothing. And I confeſſe it is true; not that which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Schollers had ſo often in their mouthes, <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> and no farther; but, <hi>ipſe dixit, &amp; facta ſunt,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſingeth: God ſpake the word, and all this gallant world roſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently out of nothing: as if ſenceleſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had heard his voyce, and obeyed him.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152599:39"/> And I am ſufficiently convinced, that God brought our firſt Father from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon earth, that we cannot touch without defiling our fingers, to earth of a finer making, call'd fleſh. But how are we made by him? wee come a naturall way into the world. And it is not ſeene, that God hath any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hand in the work. Truly, neither are the influences of the Sunne, and Starres ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to us in our compoſition; yet are they neceſſary to it. <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> The Sunne and a<note place="margin">Ariſt.</note> man betwixt them, beget a child. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule is created by God in the body, at the time when the little body now ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, is in a fit temper to entertaine it. For, the ſoule is ſo noble, and excellent both in her ſubſtance and operations, that ſhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed originally from any inferiour cauſe, nor be but by creation. And if God ſhould ſtay his hand, when the body is fitly dreſſed, and diſpoſed for the ſoule, the child would be borne but the meaneſt part of a man. And doubtleſſe, God uſeth Parents like inferiour officers, even in the framing of the Body. For, if the Parents were the true Authors, and maſter builders of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they ſhould be endued naturally with a full and perfect knowledge of that, which they make. They ſhould fully, and perfectly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152599:40"/> know, how all things are ordered, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the building. They ſhould know in particular, how many ſtrings, veins, ſinewes, bones, are diſpenſed through all the body: in what ſecret Cabinet, the braine is locked up; in what poſture, the heart lyeth; and what due motion it keepes; what kinde of Cookery, the ſtomack uſes; which way, the rivers of the bloud turne, and at what tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they meet; what it is, that gives to the eyes, the principality of ſeeing; to the eares, of hearing; to the noſe, of ſmelling; to the mouth, of cenſuring all that paſſes, by the taſte; and to the skin and fleſh, the office of touching. Nor is this all; But alſo, when the body is taken up, and borded by a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: or, when a member withers, or is cut off: truly, if the Parents were the only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the body; they might, even by the ſame Art, by which, they firſt framed it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it againe to it ſelfe. As the maker of a clock, or builder of a houſe, if any parts be out of order, can bring them home to their fit place, and gather all againe to uniformity. So that every man naturally ſhould be ſo farre skill'd in Phyſick, and Surgerie, and have ſuch an advantage of power, that his Art ſhould never faile him, even in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary practice of either. To this may be added, that the joyning together of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152599:40"/> ſoule and body, which in a manner, is the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell and a beaſt, could not be compaſſed by any, but a workman of an infinite power. For, by what limited art, can a ſpirit be linked to fleſh, with ſo cloſe a tye, as to fill up one ſubſtance, one perſon? They are too much different things: the one is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks, a ray of the<note place="margin">S. Greg. Naz</note> Divinity: the other, a vile thing, extracted from a dunghill. Nor is there any ſhew of ſemblance, or proportion betwixt them. And therfore, to make theſe two ends meet, is a work, which requires the hand, and the onely hand of the Maſter Workman. The Divines give three ſpeciall reaſons, why God joyned a body to a ſoule. Firſt, moved by his infinite goodneſſe; becauſe he deſired to admit a body, as well as a ſpirit, to the participation of himſelfe: and all creatures being ſpirituall, or corporall, a body could never have beene partaker of bleſſedneſſe, had it not beene joyned to a ſpirit. Secondly, for the more generall exerciſe of vertue in the ſervice of God: for, a ſoule could not have acted many vertues, without the aide of a body, as, the vertues of temperance, and chaſtity. For, the Devils are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the ſinnes contrary to theſe vertues, but for our guilt. Thirdly, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152599:41"/> of the univerſe. For, as there are creatures, only ſpirits, as Angels: and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures onely bodily, as beaſts and trees: ſo it was a great perfection, that there ſhould alſo be creatures, both ſpirits and bodies. By which, it is evident, that God placed man in a middle condition betwixt Angels and beaſts, to the end, he might riſe, even in this life, with <hi>Elias,</hi> to the ſublime, and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſtate of Angels: not deſcend with <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonoſor,</hi> to that inferiour, and low rank of beaſts. And by the more frequent operations of the ſpirit, in high things; we become more ſpirituall, and indeed, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall: By the more frequent exerciſe of the body, and the bodily powers, in the acts of ſenſuality; we become more bodily, and beſtiall.</p>

                     <p>ANd God gave us a being, ſo perfect in all points, and lineaments, that leſt we ſhould fondly ſpend our whole lifes in admiration of our ſelves, and at the looking-glaſſe; hee wrought his owne image in us, that guided byit, as by a finger pointing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wee might not reſt in the work, but look up preſently to the workman. The
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152599:41"/> image conſiſteth in this. God is one: the ſoule is one. God is one in Eſſence, and three in perſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt: The ſoule is one in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and three in faculties, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the will, the memory. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the firſt perſon, and begets the Son; the underſtanding is the firſt faculty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the will, I meane the acts of willing, by the repreſentation of ſomething which it ſheweth amiable. The Holy Ghoſt is the third perſon, and proceeds from the Father, and the Son: the memory is the third fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and is put into action, and being, in a manner, joyntly by the underſtanding, and will. But, here is a ſtrange buſineſſe: The Sonne, the ſecond perſon, came downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and yet ſtay'd in Heaven: The will, the ſecond faculty, and ſhe onely, goes as it were out of the ſoule, into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action, that we may ſee the ſoule of a man in the execution of his will; and yet, remaines in the ſoule. God is a ſpirit, the ſoule is a ſpirit. God is all in all the world, and all in every part of the world: The ſoule is all in all the body, and all in every part of the body. <hi>Phidias,</hi> a famous Graver, deſiring to leave in <hi>Athens,</hi> a perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of himſelfe, and an everlaſting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his Art, made a curious image
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152599:42"/> of <hi>Minerva,</hi> the matter being pretious Jvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and in her buckler, upon which in a faire diverſitie, hee cut the battails of the Amazons and Giants, hee couched his owne picture, with ſuch a rare ſingularity of Art, that it could not any way be defaced, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an utter diſſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Bucklar. This did God, before <hi>Phidias</hi> was ever heard of, or his fore-fathers through many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the ſoule of man: the image of God, though not his likeneſſe, remaining in the ſoule, as long as the ſoule remaineth, even in the damned: To this image God hath annexed a deſire of him: which in the world, lifts up our hearts to God: in Hell, begets and maintaines the moſt grievous paine of loſſe. And to ſhew, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of God, is the greateſt, and beſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; nothing, which any other deſire longs after, will ſatisfie the gaping heart; but onely, the object of this great deſire. <hi>Ad imaginem Dei facta anima rationalis,</hi> ſaith<note place="margin">S Ber. Ser. de divinis.</note> S. <hi>Bernard, caeteris omnibus occupari poteſt, repleri non poteſt: capax enim Dei, quicquid minus Deo eſt, non replebit:</hi> The reaſonable ſoule, being made after the image of God, may be held back, and ſtay'd a little dallying with other things, but it can never be fully pleas'd, and fill'd with them: for, the thing that is capable of God, cannot be filled with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152599:42"/> any thing, that is leſſe then God. The heart is carved into the forme of a Triangle; and a Triangle, having three angles or corners, cannot be filled with a round thing, as the world is. For, put the world, being ſphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, or circular, into the triangle of the heart; and ſtill, the three angles will be empty, and wait for a thing, which is moſt perfectly, one and three. And that wee might know, with what fervour of charity, and heat of zeale, God endeavoureth, that we ſhould be like to him, he became like to us. For, although God cannot properly be ſaid like to us as God, as a man is not ſaid like to his picture, but the picture to him: yet, as man, he may. And therefore, as hee formed us with conformity to his image in the Creation; ſo, hee formed himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our image, and likeneſſe in his Incarnation.

                     <p>ANd woman being made, not as man, of earth, but of man, and made in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; was not taken out of the head, that ſhe might ſtand over her husband; nor out of the feet, that ſhe might be kickt, and trod upon; nor out of any fore-part, that ſhee might be encouraged, to go before her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; nor yet, out of a hinder part, leſt her place ſhould be thought amongſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, farre behind her husband: but out of the ſide, that ſhee might remaine in ſome kinde of equality with him. And from his heart ſide, and a place very neere the heart; that his love towards her, might be hearty. And from under his left arme, that he might hold her with his left arme cloſe to his heart; and fight for her with his beſt arme, as he would fight to defend his heart. It is one of the great bleſſings, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet pronounceth to him, <hi>that feareth the Lord. Thy wife ſhall be as a fruitfull vine by the ſides of thine houſe.</hi> The vine branch may<note place="margin">Pſal. 128. 3</note> be gently bended any way; and being cut, it often bleeds to death. And the wife is a vine by the ſides of the houſe: her place is not on the floore of the houſe, nor on the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152599:43"/> roofe; ſhee muſt never be on the top of the houſe. But there is a difference: the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be a Vine, by the inſides of the Houſe. But now begins a Tragedy. It is not without a ſecret, that the Devill in his firſt exploit, borrowed the ſhape of a ſerpent; of which <hi>Moyſes, Now the ſerpent was more</hi>

                        </gap>. Knowledge, not linked with juſtice, and other vertues, is not wiſedome, but craft. And the ſerpent is crafty: For, if he can paſſe his head, his long traine being leſſe and leſſe, will eaſily follow: Hee will winde, and turne any way: He flatters out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, with gawdy ſcales; but inwardly, he is poyſon: Hee watches for you in the greene graſſe, even amongſt the flowers. Wee ſee, — that God ſuffers not the Devill to take a ſhape, but ſuch a one as will deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher his practices. And the ſerpent which deceived Eve, was crafty in a high degree of craft: for, many write, that his making
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152599:44"/> was upright; and that hee was beautified with a head and face, ſomewhat like hers. And he, that had beene throwne from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe hee deſired to be like God; comes now with a trick to the weaker of the two; and his firſt temptation, is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the deſire of being like God: <hi>Yee ſhall be as Gods.</hi> Hee knew by experience, that the deſire of being like God, was like<note place="margin">Gen 3. 5.</note> enough to lay them low enough under him. And becauſe they would be like God, Chriſt would be a man. And he comes with a faire apple; a pretty thing for the curioſity of a woman, to look upon, and deſire to touch, and play with. The holy Scripture gives three reaſons, which moved her to eat of it: three reaſons, beſides the Devil's tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; every one being gathered from ſome conceived excellencie in the fruit. <hi>And when the woman ſaw, that the tree was good for</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>food: and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe,</hi> alas foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh woman! <hi>ſhee tooke of the fruit thereof, and did eat.</hi> Shee lov'd her belly too well: Shee delighted in glittering ſhewes; and ſhe would be wiſe above her condition. And theſe are three great faults amongſt <hi>Eves</hi> daughters. But as the profeſſion of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo the deſire of wiſedome, which involveth knowledge of things above our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152599:44"/> degree, and out of our end; is an adjunct of folly. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the old Philoſophers, <hi>Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fooles.</hi> And ſhe, deſiring to be wiſe, became<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 12</note> a very foole. And now, <hi>Adam and his wife hid themſelves from the preſence of the Lord</hi>

And they doe not hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves onely, but alſo, their fault; and toſſe it from one to another. The man cries out: <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt to be with mee, ſhee gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</hi> The<note place="margin">Gen 3. 12.</note> woman cries out lowder then he: <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent beguiled mee, and I did eat.</hi> They hid<note place="margin">Ver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But, the woman makes her excuſe with leſſe fault, becauſe ſhee was the weaker party, and taught by the example of her husband. And he throwes the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wife; ſhee not back upon him, but upon the Devill. And the ſerpent, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils inſtrument in his appearance, was laid upon his belly for it: and bound to hard
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152599:45"/> fare to eat duſt, all the dayes of his life. And God goes in his curſes, as they proceeded in their ſinnes: he firſt curſes the ſerpent, then the woman, and afterwards, the man, who ſinned after them all. But had he ſtood, ſay the Interpreters, we never had fallen. And the Schoole-men give a ſufficient reaſon; for, he was the root both of <hi>Eve</hi> and us. And he cannot be freed from the greateſt fault. For, it was more in him, to be deluded by his wife; then, in her, to be deceived by the Devill.</p>

                     <p>GOd being now conſtrained to baniſh <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife out of Paradiſe: ſtay'd them notwithſtanding, within the ſight of it. They were not baniſhed into a farre Country: that they might know, they ſhould be ſhortly reſtor'd: and that, having Paradiſe alwayes before their eyes, they might loath ſin, the deadly cauſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. God created all this faire globe of the world, for man; and therefore, did not faſhion him before the ſixth day, till the houſe was furniſhed, and made in all points, fit for his entertainment. All the ſtrange va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of creatures, abiding either in Aire,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152599:45"/> Earth, or Sea, were made ſuch and ſuch, to help him forward in ſuch and ſuch manner, to his ſupernaturall end: and therefore, God gave to no creature, an upright ſtature, and a tongue to ſpeake, and praiſe him, but to man: becauſe all the benefits, hee caſt upon other things, were not given to them for themſelves, but in order to man; being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his, then their benefits. And both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and man, having fallen from God, hee turnes away from the Angels, and turnes with a ſweet face, and with loving embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unto man. For, the Angels being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with moſt eminent abilities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that, highly perfected by Grace; and having no clog of body to waigh down the ſpirit, ſinn'd of meere malice, without a Tempter, and without an example; and therefore, fell beneath the benefit of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. One reaſon of this love of God to man is prettily expreſſed, by way of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: A man, and a woman were found guilty of theft; whereof the woman, was bigg with childe. The man having nothing to ſay for himſelfe, is condemned, and ſent away to the place of execution. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cries, and pleads, ſhee is with childe; and though condemn'd, is onely ſent to priſon; where ſhee gives ſuch efficacious ſignes of her ſorrow, and Repentance; that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152599:46"/> after a while, ſhe &amp; the fruit of her womb, are ſet at liberty. Now the hiſtory turnes to a ſimilitude; and the fable becomes true hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie. The Angels had nothing to ſay, and their generations were compleat, one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell doth not beget another, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſent to the place of execution. But <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were both with child, their number was not up; they radically co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in them, thouſands of thouſands that ſhould come after them; and they were ſpar'd for their childrens ſakes, till they were ſpar'd for their own ſakes, &amp; yet all were ſpar'd for Chriſt his ſake, and wholly for his ſake. And God hath ſo play'd the good Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, with the ſinne of our firſt Parents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting many goods out of one evill; that ſome curiouſly queſtion, whether wee may, or may not be ſorry, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd. For, if wee are ſorry, that hee ſinn'd; wee are ſorry, that God's deare children, as they ſtill encreaſe their yeares, ſtill encreaſe their bleſſedneſſe. For, where good and evill meet in combat, as now, after the dayes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, there is oppoſition, and reſiſtance in the performance of good: where is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, there alſo is difficulty: and where wee diſcover a difference, and diverſity, as well in the meaſure, as in the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, there occurre alſo, degrees of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152599:46"/> and, the greater the difficulty, the more pretious the reward. If wee are not ſorry that he ſinn'd, wee are not ſorry, that God was abus'd, and his very firſt command broken. If we are ſorry that he ſinn'd; wee are ſorry, that many faire vertues have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon our knowledge, and practice, which otherwiſe, ſhould never, either have beene practiſed, or knowne: no patience of the beſt proofe, but occaſioned by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; no injury, guiltleſſe of ſinne: the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt exerciſe of our Charity towards our neighbour, ſuppoſes in our neighbour, the want of a thing requiſite; and all want of that generation, is the poore childe of ſinne: the moſt high, and moſt elevated praxis, or exerciſe of our charity towards God, then flames out, when we ſeale our beliefe with our blood, in martyrdome; no martyrdom, but uſherd with perſecution; no perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on free from ſinne. If we are not ſorry that he ſinn'd; we are not ſorry, that millions of millions of ſoules, ſhall now be loſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, loſt, never to be found again; which, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood upright, had certainely ſhone with God in Heaven, as long as hee. And, if we are ſorry that he ſinn'd; wee are ſorry, that Chriſt joyn'd our fleſh and ſoule to his Divinity; expreſſed his true love to us by dying for us; was ſeene by us here in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152599:47"/> the world, and will feaſt even the corporall eye in Heaven, with the moſt delightfull ſight of his bleſſed body, for ever. And, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſome think otherwiſe, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, Chriſt had not tooke our nature; for, he was not ſo much delighted with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as hee was deſirous to die for mankinde. And if wee are not ſorry, that he ſinn'd; wee are not ſorry, that one ſinne was the cauſe of all ſinnes; and all ſinnes, the cauſe of all puniſhments; and that, one pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is behind, and waits for us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; with which, all other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, put together, and made one puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are in no kinde comparable: and that I, and my neighbours, and he that is abroad, and perhaps now, little thinks of ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; are all ignorant, how we ſhall dye, now we are borne; how wee ſhall end our lifes, now wee are alive; now wee are put on, how we ſhall get off: and when the Ax is laid to the root, which way the Tree ſhall fall: and what ſhall become of us, everlaſtingly. Be wee ſorry, or not ſorry, <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned. It being done, God's will be done. And yet, becauſe it was but, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive will, his will of ſufferance: and hee ſuffers many things againſt his will; not of neceſſity, but becauſe he will; I will be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd, that is, offended God.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152599:47"/> God made the ſoule of man, as upright as his body, and clothed it with the white garment of originall Juſtice. God being the fountaine of all power, grace, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, could have hindred the fall; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not his neighbour, nor obliged by any law, (for, who ſhould give a law to the firſt Law-giver?) and to demonſtrate the full extent of his dominion over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he would not: and having left man <hi>in the hand of his owne counſell,</hi> and ſet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of his hand, <hi>fire and water;</hi> and man having wilfully plaid foule, God ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make the beſt of an ill game: and therefore, hee drew from the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> beſides the former benefits, a more ample demonſtration of his power, wiſedome, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, providence, and chiefly, of his charity; the triall of reaſon, the triumphs of vertue in all kindes; and the greater ſplendour of his Church. It is as plaine, as if it were wrot by the finger of God, with the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, ſpeaking of God, <hi>Non ſineret malum, niſi ex malo ſciret</hi>

                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:152599:52"/> alas, how much hee is changed from the gallant man he was! How his breath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours! how every joynt ſhakes for exceſſe of pain! How every veine trembles! His skin is drawne ſtrait to the bone through all his body. His eyes fix conſtantly upon one thing, as if there hee ſaw the dreadfull ſentence of his eternity. Two black circles lay ſeige to his eyes on every ſide; and it ſeemeth, that for feare, they are ſunke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as if they would turn preſently, and looke upon the deformity of the ſoule. Hearke; with what a lamentable accent he grones; I remember, I have heard ſome, that ſoon after came to this point, ſing, and laugh heartily. Poore man, how little all his pleaſures have profited him! Such a rich purchaſe, the favour of ſuch a noble man, ſuch and ſuch a merry meeting, what doe they help in this agonie? his freinds are preſent: yet of themſelves, they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable comforters: they may looke ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully, ſpeake mornefully, caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their knees, and pray for him; but they cannot doe the deed, they cannot helpe him: humane power ſtands amaz'd, and can do nothing. You, do you heare? what thinke you now of going abroad, and being merry; your old companions are at the doore: Looke to your goods, and your
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152599:52"/> ſelves, your houſe is on fire: not a word. And the little life, which as yet, keeps weak poſſeſſion, is ſo dull'd, and over clouded with the pangs of Death, that hee cannot raiſe from the fog of his body, one clean thought towards God, or Heaven. Hee is ready now to leave every thing, but his ſinnes, lands, houſe, friends, gay clothes, the gold in the box, and jewels in the Cabinet, and all. See, ſee; he is going, hee ſtands upon the threſhold, Death lurkes in yonder corner, and aimes at the heart; and though it move ſo faſt, Death will not miſſe his marke. Hee has beene an Archer ever ſince the world began. There flew the arrow. Here is a change indeed. His Soul is gon: but it would not be ſeene; Not only becauſe it could not, but alſo becauſe it was ſo black. Now diſmiſſe the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and pray him to goe, and invent a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the poyſon of Death. Cloſe up the dead mans eyes; hee will ſee no more. Shut his mouth; hee has left ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for aire: all is paſt, hee will never give an other croſſe word. Now caſt the beggerly wretch an old ſheete; and throw him out to the wormes; or after three days hee will poyſon us; and then, we ſhall bee like him.

                     <p>THe ſoule being created for God, and bearing his image, or ſtamp; God is the moſt proper end of the ſoule: as the earth (if it be lawfull to compare great things with little) is the moſt proper place of a ſtone. And therefore, a ſtone being toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the earth, as ſoone as it can ſhake off <hi>vim impreſſam,</hi> the impreſſion of the force which mov'd it; that being out of breath, and ſpent: if there be no ſtop, it preſently returnes with all poſſible haſte (as it were glad being let goe, and ſet at liberty) to the earth, which ownes it. And ſo, the juſt ſoul to God. The ſoule <hi>in ſtatu conjunctionis,</hi> in the ſtate of her conjunction with the body, being wedded to it, as to a fellow-helper; ſees by the eyes, heares by the eares, and in a manner, feeles by the body. Now, the ſoule having beene created in the body; and never yet us'd, but to this kinde of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the ſenſes; is ſo buſied, ſo kept in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152599:55"/> continuall work, and ſo amuſed with the repreſentations of the ſenſes, that ſhee is little urgent in the deſire of her end; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tooke up with great diverſity of other imployment; which being alwayes new, and therefore ſtrange, begets a zealous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the ſoule; and ſo, turnes her from God. It is true: if ſhe liſten to the whiſper of an inſpiration, or, heare a diſcourſe of heavenly things; ſhe likes it well, and feels a pleaſant tickling of ſweetneſſe, becauſe it is agreeable with her end: and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the deſire of her end awakes, &amp; ſits up: but other occurrences, calling earneſtly for admittance; the ſoule gives way; and the deſire of the laſt end, lyes fairely down, and ſleeps again. But the ſoul, being now <hi>in ſtatu ſeperationis,</hi> in her ſtate of ſeparation from the body, they having been newly divorced: and miſſing her body, and her accuſtomed way of knowing by the ſenſes: miſſing the former uſe of the world, and the things ſhe ſaw, and heard in the body; thinks preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where am I? I am another kind of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Then being freed from all hinderance, ſhe begins to ſtirre towards her end. For now, ſhe is like a ſtone, as farre in the ayre, as it can goe; vvhere it cannot reſt, but quit of the force, gives back: and furniſhed vvith Guides, ſhee flyes vvith all readineſſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152599:56"/> to God, in his Kingdome, the place of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallment, as to her laſt end. Here I have the reaſon, why the Divines ſay, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are two much different paines in Hell, <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> the paine of ſenſe, cauſed by the fire of Hell; and <hi>poena damni,</hi> the pain of loſſe, by the loſſe of God: the paine of loſſe, is the greateſt. For, the reprobate ſoul, being thruſt out of the body, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her doome in the very place of her expulſion; is ſtruck preſently with a ſtrong apprehenſion of her end; and of the worth, and excellency of it; and of her miſerable ſolitarineſſe without it: from which, ſhee being turned; the wound bleeds, and ſhee ſuddenly cries out, wanting a Comforter, My end, where is my end? I miſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the beſt thing, what? God. O, where is God? I miſſe my end. And then, ſhee catches at him; and miſſes: and miſſing cries out; and catches again: and ſtill miſſes, crying, I want reſt, in my end, in God. Where is my end, that is God; and God, that is my end? There is no reſt for a ſoul out of the body, but in God: as there was no true reſt, for a ſoule in the body, but in God. I have bin long at hard labour, &amp; now in the end, I would reſt, in my end. For, I cannot be at reſt, without my end. O my end! while I continue without my end, my torment will
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152599:56"/> continue without end. O, what ſhall I do? Where ſhall I begin? How ſhall I end, without my end? And then, catching at her end, ſhee is caught her ſelfe away to hell fire, and carried farther from her end. Where ſhe ſhall be alwayes catching, and alwayes miſſing: alwayes ſeeking, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finding: alwayes complaining either of her paine, or, of her loſſe, (but moſt, of her loſſe;) or, of her loſſe of all, but her paine, and her loſſe; which ſhe would faine loſe, but cannot: from which moſt wofull eſtate, God deliver me. But the juſt ſoule, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the firſt apprehenſion of her end, ſhal be joyned unſeperably to it: in which end, ſhall be the end of all earthly motion, and therefore, all reſt. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſalutes by the<note place="margin">Revel. 14. 13. <hi>Dionyſ.

At which times, ſome look very cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſmiling like Angels; and ſend from them, ſhoots of joy, and gladneſſe. And ſome looke frightfully, and fill their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber with ſhreeks, and clamours. We cannot in the generall, give the cauſes of theſe different effects. For the moſt part, it is thus. At ſuch a time, the ſoule heares her houſe crack, and now, threatning a fall. And ſhe ſees, that after the fall, all the houſe will be ſo confus'd, and out of order, that ſhee will not be able to ſtirre about, or doe any thing belonging to the keeping of a houſe: and that then, there will be no reaſon, why ſhee ſhould rather be in her houſe, then in any other part of the world. And in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, riſing to goe, and likewiſe being call'd, and alſo, thruſt forwards, ſhe puts on. And going, ſhe holds by the heart, and ſtands, as it were, with one legge in the houſe, and one without: and peeps abroad, to diſcover,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152599:57"/> whither ſhe is going: as never having been out of the houſe before. And according to the ſight of the place, ſhe muſt now take to; ſhe frames, and alters the body in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. And certainly, in this point of time, the man being ſhar'd betwixt life, &amp; death, betwixt this world and the next; the ſoule ſees, either a breaking of day, or a beginning of night. And ſo, turning againe to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, either to bid it farewell, if ſhe be happy: or, with a deſire to catch hold againe, and ſtay, if unhappy; works upon the body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apprehenſion, ſhe hath of the place ſhee goes to, gained in the diſcoverie.

I am thy ſinne of ſwearing: I was ſtay'd in the Porch of thy body, in thy mouth, to thy laſt houre in the world, and I ſweare, thou ſhalt not caſt me off now. I am thy wantonneſſe: I was thy

I am thy covetouſneſſe: and I did ſo farre covet to be with thee, and thou with mee, that Death could never part us. I am thy Anger; and I am not ſo angry, but I know what I doe: I will not be ſo baſe; after all our great aquaintance, to leave thee in my anger, when thou haſt more uſe of me: For now, thou ſhalt be moſt outragiouſly angry with God, and all goodneſſe. I am thy Pride: and now I have done my part in the world, I am onely proud of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: it is all my ambition, to follow thee.

                     <p>VVHen a man hath long dwelt in a ſtrange Country, divided; yea, far diſtant from his deare Father, &amp; friends; and now at length, begins to travell home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: how often in his way, does he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion to himſelfe in his thoughts, the face of his beloved Father, his words and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. Indeed, as hee goes, hee takes many a weary ſtep; hee ſweats often; hee blowes; and is ſometimes ready to faint: But, hee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152599:59"/> cheeres, and cleares up himſelfe; hee calls up a good heart, and thinks: when I come home, (and at the very name of home, the poore man looks cheerfully) they will run, and tell my Father, I am come. And my Father will preſently ſtart, riſe up, and ſay, Are yee ſure 'tis he? (I ſhall heare him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſee him) And not ſtaying for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he will make haſt towards me: and ſeeing me, change his countenance, and run to me, and embrace me with both his arms; and, if he be able to ſpeak for joy, cry aloud, welcome childe: and then, his joy having gone through all the expreſſions of joy, will borrow teares from ſorrow; and then, hee will laugh; and then, cry againe; and then, again laugh: and the good old man will be ſo merry. And though I be a little wet, and weary now; this will have a quick end; and I ſhall have warmth, and eaſe enough then. We are here, poore baniſh'd creatures, in a ſtrange land; very farre from our Country: wee are travelling homewards, or woe to us: Wee ſtick oftentimes in the dirt; and ſtumble in the ſtony way: we are wet, and weary: wee ſweat: every bone of us akes, heart and all. But the comfort is: All this will have an end ſuddenly: and when we come home, we ſhall ſee our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom we never yet ſaw. (For, wee
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152599:59"/> were tooke from him being very young.) And, without the help of a Meſſenger to carrie the newes, hee will know, wee are come: and riſe up, without ſtirring: and be with us, without running to us: and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace us, and hugg us in his armes; and cry to that man, and to this vvoman; vvelcome childe, deare childe vvelcome. Wee ſhall looke upon him, and hee upon us: and at the firſt ſight, we ſhall know him to be our Father, though wee never ſaw him. It is very ſtrange, but more true: Should God conceale, and hide himſelfe from us, vvhen vvee come to Heaven, and leave us in his roome, the moſt glorious Angell of them all, to looke upon; vvee ſhould naturally know, the Angell vvere not God. The ſoul out of the body, knowes naturally, God to be God, Angels to be Angels, Devils to be Devils: as vve naturally know, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh men and beaſts: and as <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocencie, knew to call every creature by his proper name. The <hi>Septuagint,</hi> or ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Interpreters, in the fift Chapter of <hi>Eſther,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tranſl. ſept. interp. in 5. cap.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152599:60"/> vulgar editions have. They report, that vvhen ſhee firſt appeared before him, her countenance vvas divided betwixt fear, and ſhamefaſtneſſe. Firſt, a modeſt bluſh ran over all her face; and then, a paleneſſe: quickly after, ſhe began to faint, and ſuffer a kind of ecclipſe of Nature: Shee fell into the armes of one of her mayds; and ſhe vvas not able to looke upon him, or ſtand before him: till hee roſe from his throne, caught her into his armes, and ſaid, <hi>What is thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest? it ſhall be even given thee, to the halfe</hi>

The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Majeſtie, vvould ſhew it ſelfe ſo terrible; that hee could not be endur'd.

From thee, who art the great ſea, out of which, all Rivers run; and to which, they ow themſelves, &amp; return. Wee were the maſter-peece of all earthly creatures: When thou hadſt created all the ſpacious Univerſe, thou diddeſt draw an abridgement, and Epitome of it, againe in us: and nothing was found in the whole Volume, which was not touch'd, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Epitome. All other creatures were framed looking downwards, toward the earth; as having nothing heavenly in them, or in heaven to hope for: thou gaveſt us faces, erected towards thee, and heaven. And ſince we have look'd towards thee, ſo long; let us be with thee now in the end, we beſeech thee. No: <hi>Depart from me.</hi> Yee have no part in me. My merits, by which, yee hope for mercy, are ſo farre from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yee, that they riſe in judgement againſt yee. <hi>Depart from mee,</hi> and goe to him yee ſerv'd; demand your wages.

Set a mark upon us: that when we are found by thine, and our enemies, they may know, to whom we belong; and ſpare us, for feare of thee. Thou that haſt ſo great ſtore of bleſſings to give; we hope, haſt one yet, in

Create a fruitfull peece of ground: let a goodly Sun daily ſhine upon it: let it have ſweet, and wholſome ayre; and be ſtor'd with fruits and flowers, of all formes, and colours: Give us under-creatures in great variety, to ſerve fitly for our uſes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are enforced to goe from thee, the ſource, and fountaine of heavenly ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; afford us plenty of earthly pleaſure, which may in ſome ſort, recompence our paine of loſſe.

The very thought of it, burneth us already: we are tormented: Come, come, let us run away, but whither? Lord God, if it be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably in thy Decree, that wee muſt goe thus naked, as we came into the world, and went out of the vvorld; into fire: let the ſentence ſtand but for a very ſhort time, quench the fire quickly: halfe an houre will ſeeme a great while there: and be alwayes mindfull, that they are thy creatures, vvho are in the fire: that they are men and vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe nature thou haſt exalted to a perſonall Unity, with thy Divinity.

And then, the world will be gone, or going, and all on fire. Shall I ever forget this day? Shall any idle mirth, or vaine tickling of pleaſure, or profit, put mee beſide the moſt neceſſary thought of this day? Shall not the conſideration of this day, cruſh out of my heart, many good, and ready purpoſes? As, Lord, open my eyes; touch them with earth, and cure my blindneſſe: that I may ſee, what I am made of, and perceive the truth of things: For, ſure I will here ſtay, and begin a new courſe in the way of Heaven: I will no longer be blinde, and ſenſeleſſe. That ſide, in which, I am weak and batter'd, with Gods holy help I will repaire: I will now waſh my garment; and afterwards, hold it up on every ſide: When a Temptation ſtands up in armes againſt mee, I will fight valiantly under the banner of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, againſt the Dragon: vvhat if the common Souldiers be fearfull, and timorous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? our Generall is a Lyon: I will ſearch with a curious eye, into my heart, and dig up all the roots of ſin. <hi>My ſoule is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in my hand,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>David;</hi> And my<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 109.</note> ſoule ſhall never be out of my hand: that

O Lord, hold thy hand now, once more: forbeare a little; and all my ſtudy ſhall be, to pleaſe thee: in all companies, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I will temember thee: And when a ſin, to which, I have been formerly accuſtomed, ſhall come againe for ordinary entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will fright it away with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of theſe powerfull words, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from mee yee curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devill and his angels.</hi>

                  <p>BEfore I leave S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Omers,</hi> I muſt needs give you a gentle touch of the Jeſuits Hypocriſie there. For, beſides other follies of that rank; they have ſet up a large pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, in a faire roome above ſtaires, where the Schollers come every day. In vvhich are pictured two ſhips at Sea; and one is taken by the other: A ſhip of Hollanders, takes a ſhip of Spaniards, wherein many Jeſuits are. The Hollanders look fierce, and cruelly: the Spaniſh Jeſuits, have all good, and heavenly faces. The Hollanders having bound the Jeſuits, hand and foot; and throwne them over-board; they ſink, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152599:64"/> dye like men, a ſpectacle full of horrour; onely ſome of them appeare floating upon the water, (I ſuppoſe, their galls are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) with faces very like dead Saints. But one of them amongſt all the reſt, can neither dye nor ſink, becauſe he beares a Crucifix in his hands, though they are bound; and the Painter hath given him a better face, then all the reſt. I would to God, theſe people did either love God truly, or not make a ſhew, they love him. And their labour is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bring the Schollers in admiration of other Jeſuits by falſe wayes: but alſo, of themſelves. For, they had one in their houſe at that time, who had beene ſtung by the old ſerpent; and was more crafty, then religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the report of all diſintereſſed perſons, that knew him: Concerning whom, part of the zealous Boyes beleeved, (and whence could this come, but from the Jeſuits ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions?) that he had ſeen the virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and that upon a time (for ſo, every tale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) ſhee had appeared to him, when hee was hot in his prayers. And when their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe led them to his chamber, they would whiſper one to another: that is the place, where the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> appear'd to Father <hi>Wallys;</hi> and they would obſerve that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with reverence. The Jeſuits have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Secular Prieſts, Adherents to their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152599:65"/> body, ſtirring men, and ſuch as they are ſure of; whom they keepe warme with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to receive them afterwards into their order; but will not preſently, for ſome ends: either that they may ſtay with them, and buy purchaſes for them, which they muſt not be ſeene to look after, and the like: or, to deale ſome other cunning buſineſſes abroad, which will not beſeeme them to act, in their owne behalfe: or, to write books in their defence, or at leaſt to prefix their names before the Books; that they may be defended, and praiſed by other men. One example will not take up much room: A Secular Prieſt of this quality, was ſent from <hi>England,</hi> not many yeares agoe, into <hi>Germany:</hi> and there, preſented a petition to the Emperour, to which many Engliſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts had ſubſcribed their names; (I ſuppoſe, all Jeſuited Papiſts.) And the matter was, to begg an Engliſh Colledge in <hi>Germany,</hi> which might be governed by the Jeſuits: which appeared a very faire Petition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Meſſenger was a Secular Prieſt. Sure, the Apoſtles of Chriſt, had little of this wiſedome. Such a man there was, now at S. <hi>Omers:</hi> who ſhewed often, to the young Frye, a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152599:65"/> hath been a Story related formerly of them, ſomewhat like this. And I am certaine, that moſt, if not all their tricks, are faſhioned in the likeneſſe of things formerly done, or ſaid to be done, for many reaſons. Invention is not ſo happy, as it hath beene. And all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſt be like, that they may ſeeme to proceed from the ſame Father. But they now ſay, this was an act of merriment. I anſwer: My Author, a Scholler, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet perſon there preſent, did not conceive it ſo; nor yet perceive, that it entred in that forme, upon the apprehenſion of others: And, it is not ſafe jeſting with exerciſes of Religion. One thing muſt not paſſe, though many doe: The Jeſuits are the moſt ſweet, and moſt honey-tongu'd people, that ever I heard ſpeak. Some of them, are ancient, and grave men, and now, ſtooping towards their grave: and yet, after every word, even when they ſpeake to young greene Boyes, they come with, yes forſooth, and, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth; their Caps being off, and a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forme of duty expreſſed: and forſooth, with, yes pray if you pleaſe, and no forſooth pray; take up a great part of their diſcourſe.</p>

Now I ſhall dive low. God is ſo faire, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that he can never appeare to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he hath made, or can make: to men, or Angels: or any creature poſſible to be made, more perfect then an Angel; ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and ſo faire, as in himſelfe, hee is. The reaſon is ponderous, and worthy to be pondered. God can never appeare to any power, in his compleat faireneſſe; except that power be of capacity to comprehend his faireneſſe: no power can comprehend his faireneſſe, except the power be of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite capacity, becauſe God is infinite: no creature can be of an infinite capacity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no creature can be infinite. The laſt propoſition, and the reaſon of it, flow natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152599:67"/> from the premiſes. But, look farther. Becauſe God in his owne Eſſence, being, and nature, being by nature moſt neere to him; is infinitely excellent: and therefore, neither doth, nor can appeare in his full ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any creature; hee doth hate eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, hate inwardly, hate from his heart, an Hypocrite: and can by no meanes, be at peace with one of thoſe; who being endued with ſhallow perfections, are but a ſmall particle of what he is, a meere atome of his excellency; and yet, make a noiſe with the ſhallow brooks; and chiefly deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more then what they are; and ſeeme to be, what they are not. If the thoughts of man, were as audible as his words, he could not beare one thing in his heart, another in his tongue: But in the creation of man, the heart was ſhut up by it ſelfe; and lyeth open to none, but him that made it; whoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; prerogative it is, to be <gap reason="foreign">

And no man aſpireth to a ſeeming excellency above himſelfe; but one ſtretched with the ſwelling of pride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the condition, in which hee ſtands; and pride hath many Companions. By which, it appeares eminently true, that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is not a melancholly, and ſingle ſin;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152599:67"/> that it goeth not without a traine; that it comes in the midſt of an Army, as if it had proclaimed open warre againſt Heaven; and therefore, is hatefull to God, for many reſpects.</p>

And when God threatneth paine, and woe, it is cleare, that thoſe with whom he dealeth, cannot be raiſed by any other meanes.

He was not tempted with the choyce cleanneſſe of her feathers; nor with her fore-ſtalling of death, and ſinging her owne obſequies: but becauſe her skinne, the root of her feathers, and her fleſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals, the organs of her muſick, were black;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152599:68"/> he rejected her, as an uncleane creature, not worthy to teach the world. The Oſtrich likewiſe, was eſteemed profane, and never admitted into Gods holy Temple; becauſe notwithſtanding all his great, and glorious furniture of feathers, he cannot lift his dull, and droſſie body above the ground. The Moone ſhineth; but becauſe it doth not heat, it is not ſuffered to ſhine by day. It is the property of good, to ſhrowd, and cover it ſelfe. God the chiefeſt good, though he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth heaven, and earth, with his glory: yet, he will not be ſeene. Chriſt, though he was perfect God, and equall to his Father: yet nothing was ordinarily ſeene in him, but a poore homely man. Who ever ſaw the ſoul of a man, his onely jewell, as he is a man? Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Yee are the light of the world.</hi> And againe: <hi>Let your light ſo</hi>

All light is commonly ſaid to be derived from the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152599:69"/> Sun: and the cauſe of all our ſhining muſt be alwayes referred, and attributed to God. And truly, when a man, for example giveth almes; kindled onely with an intention, that his neighbour ſeeing him, may glorifie his Father, which is in Heaven: his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is cleane, and ſufficiently good; but he muſt be a man of proofe, that giveth place to ſuch intentions: for he lieth wide open to the ticklings of vaine-glory, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. But I feele a ſcruple: Good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is highly vertuous, and in ſome ſort, worthy of reward, eſpecially, in perſons of eminent quality; becauſe good example is more ſeene, more admired, and goes with more credit, and authority in them: and therefore, doth more edifie, in reſpect of the high conceit wee have of their wiſedome, and knowledge. Now the hypocrite teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as forcibly by example, as the ſound, and throughly vertuous man. For, we learne in the great Theater of example, by what wee outwardly ſee: and the hypocrite is as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly faire, as the ſincere Chriſtian. It ſeemeth now, that an hypocrite doth pleaſe God, in playing the hypocrite. Not ſo: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his intention is crooked: for, he doth not intend to bring an encreaſe of good to others, but of glory, to himſelfe. If good by chance break in upon his action, it falleth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152599:69"/> beſides his intention; and it belongeth to Gods providence, as to it's proper fountain, which cruſheth good out of evill. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the prodigall man, when hee giveth prodigally to the poore, doth not intend to fulfill the law of God; but to ſatisfie his owne wilde luſt of giving.

O the foule corruption of our Times! O for ſome zealous power, that may reforme the abuſes, mine eyes have ſeene! It is one of the firſt endeavours of the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> which they exerciſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſociety of men; to gaine the good
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152599:71"/> wills of Miniſters. For, if they purchaſe the Miniſters good will, and good word; they clip the wings of the Law; &amp; hold him faſt, that hath a great ſtroke in matters concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. And where the Papiſts have great meanes, they are very free to Miniſters in their entertainments, and ſend their Coaches for them, and their wifes. But when they have beene merry, and are gone; their good name, which they left behind them, hath not as good entertainment, as they. For, the Papiſts ſay, (and I have heard them,) Theſe Miniſters are the verieſt Epicures, meere belly-gods; if we fill their bellies, we ſhall be ſure to have them our friends; when the bag is full, the Pipe will goe to our tune, a long time after. <hi>Modo ferveat olla,</hi> if the pot ſeeth, and there be warme meat providing for dinner, what care they, whether there bee a God, or no? If wee licker them throughly, with ſtrong Beere, and good ſparkling Canary; and call them to ride, and hunt with us; they will talke fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with our Prieſts, and heare them jeſt at their Religion, and at the Profeſſours, and Defenders of it; (and as freely jeſt as they:) and yet, will honeſtly keepe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: they are not Chriſtians, but Atheiſts. And thence the Papiſts fetch, as they think, a ſtrong argument againſt our Religion. And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152599:71"/> whileſt theſe Miniſters frequent their houſes with a pretence of converting them, (for ſo they tell ignorant people, that groane under the ſcandall) they ſubvert them utterly. Truly, a Miniſter, and a daily Gueſt of the Papiſts, enquired when this Book, (which I intended for the ſervice of God, and the deteſtation of Popery) came into the light; that (ſaid he) I may ſit by the fire-ſide, and laugh at it: and I beleeve, he will, if he can ſpare ſo much time from drinking. The Lord forgive him, and teach him to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall in the practicable things, in which this Book is doctrinall. But why ſhould I be oppoſed in my reaſonable proceedings againſt the Adultereſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> by my own Mothers owne children? and ſo often, by ſo many of them? or why ſhould entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or private ends be more deare to them, then Gods truth? Let every man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, what great Chriſtmaſſes they keepe, and how they abound in dancing and revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; ſtriving thereby, to make the hearts of the Country people, which are ſoone ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſuch baits, their owne; leſt they ſhould at any time, either accuſe them, or beare witneſſe againſt them. And in their houſes, many, if not the greater part, of their ſervants, were lately Proteſtants. O Lord, whither doe they pull us, one by one? I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152599:72"/> know, where having one of a Family, they made the number up five preſently; and the Father had bin but a while before, a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden: and theſe are all Attendants upon a rich Papiſt. I would their devotion did not blaze ſo much, and ſo often, like an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> lead poore Travellers out of their way. It is my opinion, grounded upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: In every day of the year, O pitty! Some, and more then we dreame of, in this little corner of the world, are drawne with queint devices, with ſmooth tearms of Art, with trim ſpeaking, and eloquent behaviour, from us, from our owne body, by them to them. O weak people, to be thus drawne! weake in life, or underſtanding: or at leaſt, weak in reſolution, ſelling Chriſt for a meſſe of pottage, or for thirty pence at moſt.

In very truth, no people were ever ſo like theſe heretikes in their practiſes, as the Popiſh Prieſts, and Jeſuits of theſe days. I have heard from themſelves, that one Jeſuit ſat ſinging in a Coblers ſhop, with his apron before him, to hide himſelfe from the Officers, that purſued him: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, councerfeited himſelfe to be drunk, and acted it rarely, that he might put a trick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Conſtable; and that a third, dancing with a Lady, heard her Confeſſion, ſin after ſin, as he met her, becauſe he wanted better opportunity. Theſe are but pranks; yet, the good Fiſhermen would not have done ſo. What black ſin will they not fix upon him, that is their enemy, though a friend to Chriſt? But here I cannot ſtay. Yet note: God hath layd a curſe upon diſſemblers, that if you neerly follow their lifes, and actions with your eyes, you ſhall clearely perceive them, often tripping, and plainely diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foule diſorder of their hearts; in crooked proceedings, that doe not favour of Evangelicall doctrine, or Apoſtolicall gravity.

Prieſts (if they will be call'd ſo) are like ſtarres, upon the powerfull influence of which, dependeth all the courſe, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this inferiour world. If they be ſtarres of a gentle, and milde aſpect, they bring health, peace, plenty, every good thing; if otherwiſe, plague, warre, famine, all miſchiefe. Either what wee preach, let us preach over, and over, and over againe, by example; or we ſhall, after all our long talking from the Pulpit, onely caſt an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive block before our weake brethren; put innocent Chriſt to the bluſh, whoſe royall perſon we preſent; and vilifie our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

For, in a diverſity of things, there muſt be order, or confuſion.

I grant willingly, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is outwardly one, and orderly; but this may be policy, not religion. If ſhee be one, and orderly, as ſhee ought to be; ſhee muſt be one in faith, and doctrine with the Apoſtles; and the ſame in doctrine, and practiſe. The Cameleon (they ſay) ſheweth all colours on her skin, but white and red:

                  <p>A word here, pray. It is paſt my graſpe, to comprehend, (and I beleeve, beyond the Sphere of all our Activities) how the notes, and marks, by which the Romaniſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to know the true Church, when they ſee it; may in reaſon be noted for ſuch. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity is an accidentary thing, a thing ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (if a thing may be ſaid ſeperable, which was never joyned) from the true Church; and a thing common to it with other Churches. Accidentary, becauſe it founds not the Eſſence of the Church, but happens to it by the fluencie of Time. Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe the old Church in the dayes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the new Church in the time of the Apoſtles, ſtood firme, and was it ſelfe, without it. Common, becauſe the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian falſhood, which triumpheth in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues of Sathan, was borne almoſt as ſoone as truth; and unchriſtian falſhood, before her. Multitude is not ſo proper to the true Church: becauſe it agreeth neither alwayes, nor alone, nor altogether to her: Not alwayes, becauſe neither to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152599:76"/> Church, nor to the Church in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and other perſecutions. Not alone to her, it is as well knowne, as the Sunne. Not altogether to her, becauſe although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are called, yet few are choſen. Of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, there is one of doctrine, another of perſons: the firſt is a mark, the ſecond is a mark to the ſenſe, not to the ſoule. There is alſo, a two-fold Union, one myſticall, and ſpirituall, in the bond of faith; another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, in the bond of profeſſion. That is a plaine mark, not this. And Union is not proper to the Church alone. For, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the world of Infidels, are often uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>The Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſell together againſt</hi>

                     <hi>the Lord, and againſt his Annointed.</hi> It is a cloſe Union, when they joyne both their perſons, and their Counſells. And Union doth not alwayes agree to the Catholike and Univerſall Church; becauſe particular Churches are oftentimes divided, and torne with diſſentions. As, the Church of <hi>Greece</hi> differs in many points from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Roman Church dealing with us, calls matters of faith; and yet, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will turne about againe, and ſtile her onely, a Schiſmaticall part of the true Church, cut from the communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing externall, but not from the body of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152599:77"/> Church: And her Prieſts, with licence from his Holineſſe, may ſay a Grecian Maſſe upon a Popiſh Altar. And high Maſſe after the Grecian cuſtome, is ſung every yeare upon S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his day in <hi>Rome,</hi> even by Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. And many particular Churches, and private Doctors amongſt the Papiſts, cry up for matters of faith, the points which others throw into the number of private opinions: and theſe all deeme themſelves to ſtand under one and the ſame Verticall point of Religion. Theſe marks may ſuit as agreeably with the Beaſt, in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as with the Church.</p>

For, people are no ſooner entred into the Colledge, but they are put in minde, what the Jeſuits have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in <hi>England,</hi> for the Catholike faith; in this manner. There ſtand in an open place before them, as they enter, the pictures of Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> (that ſuffered in the matter of the Gunpowder treaſon) and others: wherein great Knifes are pictured opening their breſts, to their very hearts, the blood running out in abundance. And the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards

And if I remember aright, as men goe farther into the Colledge; there offer themſelves to their eyes, pictures of late perſecutions in <hi>England:</hi> where they have pictured us in print, throwing the Papiſts, being covered with beaſts skins, to doggs: but their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention hath ſome ground, in the Primitive Church. Some things I learned in this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which brought me into an extreame loathing of the Jeſuits: As, that a Jeſuite preached in a publike Aſſembly, the fall of the houſe in <hi>London,</hi> upon the Papiſts, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in <hi>Black Friars,</hi> to have beene cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Puritanes, who did undermine it. And that in the time, when the Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der treaſon was in hatching, a Secular Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alladolid,</hi> where the Court was then reſident; and lodged in the Colledge: And his buſineſſe was, to ſollicite the Councell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for ayde towards the perfection of the Plot: but the Councell would not yeeld, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152599:78"/> that ſuch a caſe might in time, be their owne. And yet, the Jeſuites would now faine put upon the world, that the Plot was not intended, or as much as fore-knowne by them. Let God witneſſe for me; that in this Colledge, I heard two, whereof the one was a Jeſuite, the other, a Jeſuited Scholler, talking after this manner. It was very neere, ſaid the Jeſuit, that I ſhould have beene one in that Plot of the Gunpowder treaſon; and though it was diſcovered, I would to God, I had beene one of the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in that cauſe. I, ſaid the Scholler, now it tooke no effect, every one ſpeaks againſt it; but had it beene proſperous in ſucceſſe, it would have beene extolled to the Heavens, by all our ſide. Let every man take his own way: It is my beliefe, that the Jeſuits were the firſt Plotters of it, &amp; the chiefeſt Actors in it. Another reaſon, which here created in me, a loathing of the Jeſuits, (to paſſe by, many others) was; becauſe I heard it, and ſaw it come reeking from an Arch-Jeſuits mouth; that the Converſion of <hi>England</hi> to them, could never be effected, but by blood. And it hath not beene knowne (ſaid he) that ſo ripe haereſie was ever ſuppreſſed, but by the ſhedding, and effuſion of much blood. The man look'd bloodily, when he ſpoke it. But my Maſters, and you that with me, have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152599:79"/> proteſted againſt the corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> one queſtion: What ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can wee promiſe to our ſelves, that are beſet in all places, with ſuch bloody Butchers of men: one of whoſe chiefe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples it is, that we muſt be layd wallowing in our owne blood, or they cannot compaſſe their much deſired ends? I have ſtay'd too long, from the relation of one paſſage: In the firſt voyage of the Engliſh to <hi>Cales</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> be like, one of our Souldiers, ſeeing a faire Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in one of their Churches, and thinking to prevent their farther worſhip of it; cut it more then once, over the face with his ſword. The Engliſh Navy being gone; order was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently given, and taken, that whereas ſuch a gallant Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> had beene irreverently abuſed by the Engliſh, the Engliſh againe ſhould uſe it reverently. And it was preſently ſent to the Engliſh Colledge in <hi>Valladolid:</hi> where it ſtands o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the high Altar, with a cut face, the skars yet remaining, as marks of honour; but dreſſed moſt richly, and adorned with a pretious Crowne: And this they call, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they think, our bleſſed Lady. Shee hath a rich Wardrope, and great change of Gownes: one of white Sattin with gold lace; another of red; another of green Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152599:79"/> and yet another of blew; beſides her cloth of gold, for high dayes: and the worſt day in the week, the Image goes in Sattin (while the poore are naked;) and farther then all this, is as brave in action, as in clothes; for, it works a wondrous ſtore of miracles; but I had not the honour, to ſee one of them. Only, one of the Jeſuits came one day after dinner, haſtily to us Schollers, and told us with much laughter, how he had perſwaded a good old wife, that ſhee was cured of her infirmity by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> though ſhe did not feele eaſe ſuddenly; and that ſhe muſt not faile to bring the figure in wax, of the part cured, and hang it up with other figures of that kind, before the Image, in honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the memory of the Miracle.</p>

                  <p>I Will not have to doe with Controverſie, but as it lyes in my way. For, if I turn my ſtile altogether, from the ſweet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comforts of the Spirit, to the noiſe, and loud alarums of Controverſie, I am a fiſh took out of the water. And therefore, I profeſſe, if they write a thouſand times, and I anſwer as often; I will never ſtirre a foot,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152599:80"/> from this very ſpirituall way of writing: let them object a diſability on my ſide, or what they pleaſe. The command of Chriſt, to my ſoule; is, Goe and preach; and every thing that comes from mee, while I am I; ſhall be, if it be holy, an act of obedience to that command. But, I loſe time. This I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage-worſhip, performed with much bending of the knee, and body; is a learned kinde of Idolatry. <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> entitled by them, <hi>Scriptor Catholicus,</hi> the Catholike Writer, confeſſeth, it was a cuſtome intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced firſt, in imitation of the Pagan Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. But who can give a law of religious worſhip, which took not beginning from Chriſt, or his Apoſtles? God forbiddeth all worſhip of this ugly ſtamp, in thoſe holy words of the law: <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow downe thy ſelfe to them, nor ſerve them.</hi> We ſee, that<note place="margin">Exo. 20 5.</note> the prohibition impoſeth a tye upon the outward geſture. And their anſwer will not hold together; that we are onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, not to make, or bow downe to an Image, which wee make as well our God, as our Image; and bow to, as to our God: becauſe God in his law, immediatly addeth: <hi>For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</hi> Jealouſie in us, is a ſuperfluity of love, and being mingled with feare, and ſuſpition; feareth every ſhadow, and appearance of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152599:80"/> neglect, and ſuſpecteth every likeneſſe of evill. And therefore, howſoever they change the phraſe, and plead, that the worſhip dwelleth not in the Image, but lodging as it were, at the ſigne of the Image, goeth on her journey to God, and to the Saint: Yet God, being ſtill a jealous God; his jealouſie will be very fearefull, and ſuſpitious of all worſhip, which is not directed the next way to him: for, though his love be cleane from all defect; acting with us, now his part is the jealous Lover. And what a puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is here, of ignorant peoples brains, with theſe <hi>ordinations,</hi> and <hi>terminations?</hi> And this holy parcell of holy Scripture, <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jew with us, maketh a part of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandement. But, with what threats, and promiſes, God keeps us to the keeping of this Commandement? <hi>Viſiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the children,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me. And ſhewing mercy unto thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them that love me, and keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> The iniquity of the Fathers, ſhall be puniſhed in the children, if they be alſo children of their ſinnes, and idolatrous practiſes: but hee will ſhew mercy unto thouſands, whoſe Fathers abhorred ſuch odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes, yea though their children are not inheritors of all their Fathers vertues;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152599:81"/> becauſe hee is more prone to mercy. And as farre as thouſands exceed in number, the third and fourth generation; ſo farre will his mercy be more active, and operative, then his Juſtice. And this odd kinde of worſhip, is exceedingly ſcandalous to all the heatheniſh world of unbeleevers; and eſpecially to the Jews; who yet ake both in body and ſoule, and know they doe ſo, partly for their Fathers old ſins of Idolatry. There ſtandeth a great woodden Image of the Crucifix, in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>Rome.</hi> But why doe I ſay, it ſtandeth? Alas, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand. Out of which, they teach, that Chriſt talked with St. <hi>Brigit.</hi> And the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine being drawne, the people fall downe before it, and ſigh, and knock their breaſts: and then, the little beads drop. I have ſeene an Image of the Sun, through the mouth of which, in the old time, the devill ſpake to the people. But while I am reaſonable, I ſhall not beleeve, that God would ever ſpeak out of an Image, and tempt ſome to Idolatry; and confirme others in it. And, it doth not ſuit with his greatneſſe, to come ſo neere the devill in his wayes; who long deceived the world, by a counterfeit way of ſpeech in Oracles; and who practiſed to ſpeak in Images, almoſt from the beginning of the world. Indeed, the great Doctors of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152599:81"/> the Church, commonly call the devil, Gods Ape; becauſe hee much labours to be like him, that he may paſſe for him, and deceive with more Authority: But no good man hath ever ſaid in expreſſe termes, that God doth imitate the devill: for, when wee imitate another, wee learne ſomething of him. And they will not deny, if they be not braſſe all over, but, as well their Prieſts, tutored by the devill, as the old Prieſts, in imitation of the devill, have ſpoke to the people from the mouths of Images. And the dreſſing of Images in ſilks, and velvets, what is it, but the baby-ſport of children? onely, the little childe hath more wit, then to worſhip his idle Baby. I have ſeene an old worme-eaten Image of the virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> carried with all earthly pomp and triumph in Proceſſion; to which, the people kneeled, where it came, with as humble ſubmiſſion, as they could have done to God himſelfe, if hee had there appeared, with all his Court of Angels, in his Glory: And before this Image, I, becauſe I was ſomewhat dexterous in obſerving the State of their Service; was admitted, even to the ſaying of Maſſe. Shall man, the living Image of God, worſhip the ſenſeleſſe Image of a man or woman, being a more ignoble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then himſelfe? As the perfections of all
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152599:82"/> things joyne hands in God, with an infinite acceſſe of excellence: So the perfections of all things but God, ſcattered in them, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one another in man; in a finite, and bounded manner. Man hath being with a ſtone; is, lives, and encreaſes with a plant; is, lives, encreaſes, and is ſenſible with a beaſt; is, lives, underſtands, and is ſpirituall on the ſurer ſide, with an Angell. It is a ſtrange ſaying, but as true as truth: An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is more perfect then a man; but a man is enriched with more perfections then an Angell; and comes more nigh to his Maker this way, then an Angel. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>Thou haſt made him a little lower then the Angels.</hi> The Angel indeed, is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly<note place="margin">Pſal 8. 5.</note> perfect, as being of a finer ſubſtance, and borne with large naturall knowledge, and without the troubleſome connexion of a body. But man is ſtored with a fairer number of perfections; albeit thoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which the Angel hath, ſpread far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in faireneſſe, then theſe of man. Shall this faire creature, the noble work of God, worſhip the meane work of man, an Image? which is but aſhes in the likeneſſe of an Image: and which, the Popiſh Doctors confeſſe, if a Papiſt or other perſon, be driven with extremity of colde, hee may burne, to relieve his body. Goe now man, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152599:82"/> him, who, when thy body falleth to the poore condition of a ſtone, or block, or of the Image, that men would perſwade thee to worſhip; and ſtirreth onely as it is moved by a living power; and ſhall be left, not a man, but the Image of a man; the Image of God being departed with, and in the ſoule: ſhall acknowledge his owne Image, if not defaced with the worſhip of Images, or other ſinnes; and call thy ſoule, and his Image, home to his reſt.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot come ſo nigh, but I muſt needs have one pluck at the invocation of Saints. By what device can we invocate the Saints, without great injury to Gods glory? For, the more help we crave, and expect from others, though with ſome reference to God, the leſſe wee ſeeme to depend upon God; and want of dependance, be it reall, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and onely in appearance, breeds neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. And a ſimple wretch, beleeving, that in what place ſoever of the world he is, hee is there heard by his Saint, and his petition granted, and as they teach, more eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: doe you think, his heart is not vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently prompted to deifie his Saint? I have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:152599:83"/> heard an Italian ſay in <hi>Rome,</hi> (and hee ſpoke to me, when he ſaid it) being tranſported with a high thought of the Popes greatnes, ſo like the greatneſſe of God; that hee did exceedingly pitty the poore blind Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who beleeved aright in ſome things, and embraced many verities, as, that there is one God, and three perſons, and the like: and yet, did not beleeve ſo plaine, and open a matter, that the Pope is God upon earth. But, they meet me, as I goe: A vile ſinner is unworthy to appeare before God in his owne perſon. Is it ſo? Why then doth Chriſt make publike proclamation? <hi>Come unto me all yee that labour, and are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11 28</note> 
                     <hi>and I will give you reſt.</hi> Wee muſt come unto him, that giveth reſt. And all muſt come, even they that labour under the waight of a burdened conſcience; they that are in labour, and deſire to be delivered of a Hedghog, that wounds, and teares them in their tender inſide. The ſpirits labour, when men are upon dying: and wee that labour to keepe life and ſoule together, muſt come to him. And it is God, who, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Humilia reſpicit in coelo, &amp; in terra,</hi> looks back upon the humble things of heaven and earth: For, as the low things of earth, are humble in reſpect of him; ſo alſo, the ſublime, &amp; high things of Heaven.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:152599:83"/> But he bowes downe his attention to all as the Sun viſiteth with equall cleareneſſe, the garden of flowers, the greene medow, the field of Lillies, and the dirty ditch. One example is eminent. <hi>And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the ſame coaſts, and cryed unto him, ſaying, Have mercy on mee O</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 22</note> 
                     <hi>Lord thou Son of David, my daughter is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly vexed with a devill.</hi> Shee was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Canaan, but, for her unworthineſſe, her name is concealed. And ſhee came out of the ſame coaſts, but what coaſt, or where her houſe ſtood, or whether or no ſhe had a houſe, wee muſt not learne. And yet, ſhee boldly cries unto him for mercy. She gives him his titles, by which ſhe acknowledges his power, and his gentleneſſe. For, ſhe calls him Lord, and the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> a meek man. And ſhee goes to him for a remedy againſt the devill, that came to deſtroy the works of the devill. Her daughter was poſſeſſed with a devill: and, <hi>quod poſſidetur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> expounding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition<note place="margin">Tho. Aqu. 1. p. q. 10. art. 1.</note> of Eternity, given by <hi>Boetius, firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; quietè habetur:</hi> We hold faſt, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, the thing we poſſeſſe. Yet ſhee hopes, and feares; and feares, and hopes againe, and in that hope, goes to him couragiouſly. Now, certainly, hee will come running towards her, and meet her above halfe way.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152599:84"/> It is quite otherwiſe. <hi>But hee anſwered her not a word.</hi> O poore woman! why then<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> the Popiſh doctrine will appeare probable. Chriſt will not anſwer a word to a vile ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſpeaking in her owne perſon. Had he but look'd upon her with a compaſſionate eye, and ſaid, Alas poore woman, ſhe would have called him, Son of <hi>David,</hi> once again. <hi>But he anſwered her not a word. And his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came, and beſought him, ſaying, Send her away, for ſhe crieth after us.</hi> She follow'd ſtill: and her cries went before her: if hee will not ſee her, he ſhall heare her; and he ſhall know, that ſhe is a woman. His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples begin to think, that ſhee is as much vext with a devill, as her daughter, ſhee cries ſo loud; and beſeech him to ſend her away. <hi>But he anſwered, and ſaid, I am not ſent, but to the lost ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> Poore wretch, what ſhall become of her? She is loſt, and loſt againe; loſt in her ſelfe, and loſt in her daughter: but ſhee is not of the ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if hee be ſent to none, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee will never finde her, though ſhee be loſt, and hee finde what is loſt. <hi>Then came ſhe and worſhipped him, ſaying, Lord, help mee.</hi> Make roome,<note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> give way there, now ſhe comes. She breaks through the preſſe, and down ſhe falls upon
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:152599:84"/> her knees before him; ſhee feares that ſhee was rejected, becauſe ſhe had not worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him; and now, ſhe humbles her heart, and her body, and lifts up her hands, crying, <hi>Lord help me.</hi> Is it poſſible now, that Chriſt ſhould not melt into compaſſion, and thaw into ſweet drops of teares, and mercy? <hi>But he anſwered, and ſaid, It is not meet to take the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>childrens bread, and to caſt to dogs.</hi> What? a dog? If ſhee be a dog, ſhee is not a curſt dog. Was ever a dog heard to cry, <hi>Lord help me?</hi> I wonder, ſhe breaks not out: Am I a dog? I would have you well know, I am not a dog, I am a woman. You a man ſent from Heaven, and call a woman dog? Had I beene call'd any thing, but an unclean dog, I had not car'd. I doe not remember, that I ever bark'd, or bit any man. And muſt I now, be call'd a dog? Her language is of another ſtraine. <hi>And ſhe ſaid, Truth, Lord:</hi>

                     <hi>yet the doggs eat of the crums which fall from their Masters table.</hi> The woman will be a dog, or any thing that hee calls her; and ſhee confeſſes, that her place is the doggs place, under her Maſters Table; and all that ſhe deſires, is, that ſhe may lick up the little crums, which fall from his trencher. But Chriſt could hold no longer; his very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels yern'd; and hee gave her, her full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, good meaſure, preſſed downe, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  <p>IT is my beliefe, that the Invocation of Saints is a by-way, which the devill hath ſought and found, to divert man from the due, and true ſervice of God. All the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the devill, ſaith <hi>Nilus,</hi> are thus and thus ordered, to diſturb or pervert us in our prayers. And, we ſee, hee hath already ſo farre gained ground, that where they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up a hundred prayers, they give but ten in the hundred to God. And they proclaim it, an infallible ſigne of predeſtination, to flame in devotion to the virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And where the Church of Chriſt prayeth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, O Lord open thou our lips; they began their Office of the virgin <hi>Mary, Domina labia mea aperies,</hi> O Lady open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe: till the Pope a ſhamed of them and their open lips, ſhut up their lips with ſhame enough. And they ſeldom ſay, praiſe be to God, without a profane addition, and to the virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> dividing their praiſes in the ſame breath, and (it is to be ſuſpected, they are alſo quick, and many ſo ignorant) moſt commonly in the ſame gift of the mind, betwixt Chriſt, and his Mother; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152599:86"/> the Creator, and the creature. It hath bin openly confeſſed to me in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the common people there, for the moſt part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is as really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament as Chriſt; and ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it, ſaying, that the fleſh of the virgin. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is there, becauſe Chriſt took his fleſh from her. And ſo, it is very neere to cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, Prayer is the aſcent of the mind to<note place="margin">Io. Damaſc. lib. 3. de fide orthodox. cap. 24.</note> God. Three things are required to every action, that is both perfect and noble. Firſt, the action muſt be of a perfect kinde; and ſuch a one is the action of aſcending. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the action muſt flow from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable beginning, or principle; and ſuch a one is the minde, the moſt pure, and moſt refined part of the ſoule. And thirdly, it muſt tend to an excellent object; and God excells all objects, but himſelfe. I cannot perceive, how God being ſo prone of himſelfe to goodneſſe, that hee hath made himſelfe in a manner, viſible in his creatures: that he ſent his owne deare Sonne from his warme bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152599:87"/> to bleed to death for us: there is now, the ranſome being fully payd, ſo great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of mediatours, to put the ſweetneſſe, and love of heaven and earth, in minde of his promiſe to Man. For, they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their own glory, by what they doe in Heaven. There is yet, a ſtrong neceſſity of prayers, and other duties on our part. But is there yet, need of Saints, to blow the coals, and to ſtirre up his halfe-extinguiſhed love to man? and all this, when the Son of God, is alſo the Son of man, both God and man, to interpret betwixt God and man, and to deale the cauſe on both ſides. <hi>One Mediator betweene God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Timothie.</hi> One Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> both for the maine matter of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and the continuance of it. It is added, <hi>the man Christ Ieſus,</hi> that we may goe bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him; we men, to the man, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. It cannot be denied, but hee ſits at the right hand of God, and makes interceſſion for us; and if ſo, why ſhould any be joyned with him, in maintaining the continuance of the league betwixt God and man, which he made? I meane, any that we muſt looke up to, and that ſhall deal the ſame buſineſſe in the ſame place, and with more aſſurance of reconcilement, then he. The Miniſter is a Mediatour betwixt God and Man; but not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:152599:87"/> one, that is inviſible; and above, as God is. Certainly, God could have given his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, without the motion of prayer; but the device was, to exerciſe us in humility, and obedience towards him, us here below; and in the performance of charitable offices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbours; for our greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement hereafter. And ſhould it be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to them, to the Papiſts, that the Saints expreſſe their charity to us, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us; it will not preſently follow, that we muſt be Petitioners to them: For, they may pray for us, that is, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement of our laſt end; and yet, not know the particularities of our conditions; and not be able to heare our prayers. It is a great way to the place where the Saints dwell, and we pray ſoftly. And therefore, God heareth us, becauſe he is every where, <hi>Intra omnia, ſed non incluſus; extra omnia, ſed non excluſus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> within all<note place="margin">Iſid.</note> things, but not ſhut in them, without all things, but not ſhut out of them, And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Saints ſhould behold in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, in whom are all things, what we doe, and pray for: yet ſtill they are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and their powers limited. And if the whole world, ſhould pray to a Saint at the ſame time, it would be a great imployment, to give hearing to all the multitude. He that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152599:88"/> ſees him, who ſees all things, ſees but a little of what hee ſees, that ſees all things; And the bleſſednes of the ſeers, doth not ſo much, as partially conſiſt, in the ſeeing of what is done below: And that God imparteth to them, any ſuch revelations, by which they may appeare to us, ſo like to him; wee are not warranted to beleeve. I rather think, that the wills of the Saints and Angels in Heaven, lye faſt aſleepe in the will of God. No Saint would grieve for his Father, though he ſhould know, he is now broiling in the moſt ſearching flames of eternall fire: becauſe his will is wholly reſigned to the firſt, and ſuperiour will in the order of wills, the will of God. He grieves not for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſentence of God hath paſt upon him; and the ſentence is irrecoverable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is abſolutely will'd. And who can make it credible, that the Saints know, what ſentences are paſt, and what are yet to paſſe? I was borne a poore beggar; When I could not begg; and I live a beggar, and ſhall dye one. My cry ſhall ever be; Good Maſter, my Maſter, and Maſter of all the world; give ſomewhat to a poore beggar, for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</p>

                  <p>I Blame exceedingly in the Jeſuits, and others, their neglect of holy Scripture. An old man amongſt them, and a profound Scholler, ſaid in a vaunting way, that hee had never read a word of holy Scripture in holy Scripture, but as he found it ſcattered, and cited in other books. And when I made a Latin Play amongſt them, and (God in his tenderneſſe, forgive me for it) acted the part of a Miniſter, and preached upon the Stage, having took for my text, thoſe holy words of Chriſt to St. <hi>Thomas, Bleſſed are they that</hi>

                     <hi>have not ſeene, and yet have beleeved:</hi> Moving exceſſive laughter at every word; I was not reprehended by them, but highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. And in <hi>Rome,</hi> when I compoſed a Play of a mixture of Engliſh and Latin, and ſtill perſonated a Miniſter, though I much profaned the words, and phraſes of holy Scripture; all paſt for very well done. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almoſt, is more common with the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, then to frame their jeſts, of the phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or paſſages of holy Scripture: which becauſe they are witty; pleaſe and ſpread exceedingly. It is worthy to be learned, that as in all ſubordinate Sciences, they ſo
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152599:89"/> contrive the ſtates and reſolutions of their queſtions, that they may ſerve the better to the ſetling of their Doctrine in Divinity; ſo they have the like ayme, even in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary carriages; if the carriage be capable of it. And running with this byas, they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect even outwardly, holy Scripture; that in Divinity, they may the more ſeemingly inferre the inſufficiencie of it in the deciſion of Controverſies; forming an argument out of their owne practice; with which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, though no argument, they are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently convinced, to whom their practice is a Canon, and indeed, holy Scripture it ſelfe. There came to this Colledge, when I was there, a poore old forlorne Spaniſh Souldier; and his arrant was, to begg an almes. This is ordinary; and wherefore ſhould I relate it? The extraordinary is to come. He confeſſed weeping, to ſome of the Schollers; that he had beene a buſie man in the great Fleet, that came for <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes: and that the heavy hand of God had ſo waighed him downe in all his enterpriſes, ſince the foule attempt of that miſchievous Plot, that he could never proſper in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affaires: nor yet, ſee any man, who had engaged his perſon in that buſineſſe, that proſpered: I may ad out of his words; that ſeemed not to beare with <hi>Caine,</hi> or like a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152599:89"/> wandering Jew, the curſe of God upon his forehead. O all yee true Engliſh hearts, love God, and ſerve him. The Jeſuits per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will deny, they had any hand in that Invaſion. But leſt they deceive you, I will tell you ſome news from <hi>Rome.</hi> It is known there, that the Pope tooke, and the Jeſuits gave, the better halfe of the Colledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes, ſold out-right, to the uſe of that Fleet: And that the Scholers were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown with the Navy; For, the number of Scholers being great, and now, greatly neglected; part of them, by the fearfull judgement of God, were forced to beg from Town to Town. And I have heard of a great Extremitie, into which ſome of them fell; but the form of it is quite falne out of my mind. Still praiſe thou, God, ô my ſoul. I have read a Latin book in <hi>Rome,</hi> written by Father Parſons (the Jeſuite that I told you, ſate in the Coblers ſtall) after Gods expreſſion to us in the overthrow of the Fleet; where he labours to reduce that overthrow, (as Fa. <hi>Floyd</hi> the Jeſuit, did the fal of the houſe in <hi>Black friars</hi>) not to an act of Gods good pleaſure, but of his ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

It is very ordinary in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, to give faire cauſes for foule ones; <hi>Non cauſam pro cauſa,</hi> That which was not the cauſe, for the cauſe it ſelfe. Every cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man doth ſo. My memory beares mee witneſſe, I have been told by them; that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the time of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> fleet, or of the Gunpowder Treaſon, the Jeſuits thought themſelves ſo ſecure of a ſucceſſe, agreeable to their mindes; That they had caſt, and written, how all things ſhould be ordred in Parliament for their advantage; and for the prevention of differences betwixt them, and the Monks, concerning Houſes. Which was one of the Reaſons, why <hi>Leander Jones,</hi> an Engliſh Monke, wrote his Book concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Houſes &amp; Lands in <hi>England,</hi> due to his Order. But now I ſpeak of the Monks; I muſt come to them anon; for I came to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Every wiſe, and indifferent perſon, and the perſon, that is but indifferently wiſe; will plainly ſee, that I had reaſonable motives, (and yet, theſe were not halfe) ſufficient to induce a diſcourſing man to forſake the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; if not, the Popiſh Religion. But, though I had enough of the Jeſuits, I ſtill deſired to be ſeeing, in the weighty matter
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152599:90"/> of Religion. And of my own accord, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Jeſuits, and <hi>Spain;</hi> and betook my ſelfe to the Engliſh Monaſtery at <hi>Doway,</hi> in <hi>Artois.</hi> For, I thought, if any where, there was the beginning of the life of Saints, and Angels.

                  <p>IT is too early to take my leave of <hi>Spain;</hi> Every day came to our eares a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the abomination of deſolation in the practices of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Their ſins were common talk; and namely, the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commixtions of men with women, of men with men, can we bend our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion farther? Of men with beaſts; O moſt holy God! And I remember, a Drunkard did fright me in <hi>England.</hi> Their religious perſons are much tainted with theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable acts of Irreligion. And theſe are not <hi>Spains</hi> ſins onely, but alſo, the ſins of <hi>Italie,</hi> where the Pope dwels; and of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, where his beſt houſe is, &amp; where he is to be ſeen for the moſt part: Why now the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152599:91"/> Prophecie of the Reverend, and godly Biſhop <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> is come about: and the branding of lawful Mariage in the Clergie, hath put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on, to breake all the tyes, and ligaments of Nature, and Religion; and to tread deep in the dark, and dirty wayes of miſchief. They have pleaſed, to give out heer, that I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not, becauſe I judge it unlawfull, and forecaſt a returne to them. But let them know that I remayn free, as from Marriage, ſo from any tye, pulling that way; for two Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to take off the ſharpneſſe of the ſcandall, which they raiſed of mee, that I changed my Religion for a Wife.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe as yet I lie dead and buried in an obſcure Village, where no man that is an Inhabitant, except the Clerke, bringeth a Booke to Church; and where no man is able to judge of my Vocation; or of the wonderfull things, which God hath ſhewed to me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to tell upon the houſe-top.</p>
                  <p>But when GOD in his mercie, ſhall make mee a fixed Star, and ſettle me in a conſtant abode; I ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to marry, as many good ſervants of God, as well ordered as I, have done. I was called to Orders, to the ſweet yoke of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152599:91"/> Chriſt; to which the Pope had annexed a yoke of iron: I could not, where I was, put on the one, without the other. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did not force mee upon Orders; but ſhee forced mee to put on the iron yoke with Orders. And becauſe I put it on by enforcement, and the enforcement was unlawfull; I may lawfully ſhake it off, and ſay; of all Rules, Scripture is the beſt. A promiſe not regulated by the Word of God, will never be found obligatory. It will be much for me, to promiſe to God, or to my ſelf, an aſſurance of Chaſtity; becauſe Chriſt hath not bound himſelfe, to furniſh us always with extraordinary Graces. His intention is, to bring us to ſalvation by the common rules of Chriſtianitie; and by Graces, which ordinarily do <hi>gratos fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> as the neceſſary Graces of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In higher matters; as, in Graces <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis datis;</hi> thoſe of Edification, and the like; he will be always at his own choice. Onely this. The condition was Antichriſtian, the will was forced, not abſolutely, but by a ſlight; and the matter of the Promiſe, was unlawful. Some are Eunuches for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven: but theſe hang from day to day upon Gods extraordinary Grace, which doth not forſake them: they doe not promiſe ſo high a grace to themſelves,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152599:92"/> by vowing the performance of a duty, which falls not within their power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary proceſſe; and to which, they are but Gods Tenants at will, in all reſpects.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Spaniards</hi> are odiouſly proud, and boaſting both in their words, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. But the Jeſuits have a plaiſter for the deformity; and ſay: The pride of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> is onely the outward repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pride, and the acting of a proud man's part; but the Engliſhman is proud in heart, and the true <hi>Lucifer.</hi> But what man, can meaſure <hi>the abundance of the heart,</hi> but by the out-ſide?

They ſay, their intention was, to convert him. But, Lord deliver my body, and my ſoule, from being converted by them. All in God, is moſt excellent; but wee call that, more then moſt excellent in him, which We are beſt acquainted with, his mercy, and his Gentleneſſe. And, not to be like God in that, in which he moſt ſhews himſelf to us, is high neglect. You ſee, I take but heere and there, and where I take, I do but touch. I will keep ſome thing for hereafter, to be uſed if they goe on to trouble the peace of my ſweet repoſall in the boſome of my deare Mother; the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>Spain,</hi> according to the Law of the Realme (but not according to Gods Law) if a man

                  <p>The Jeſuits know a Gentleman, who ſent a diſh of hot meat covered to a Friary, the ſhaved head of a Friar; and it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Friars being at dinner; with this Meſſage, that ſuch a Gentleman, a good Benefactor of theirs, had ſent them a diſh from his Table; and many thanks were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with acknowledgment, that they were much beholding to him, and alwayes bound to him by new favours. But the Meſſenger, uncovering the diſh, began with the other end of his Meſſage, and fairely told the Friars, that as many of them as came where he was found (for, he had ſpared his wife) his Maſter would ſerve with the ſame ſawce. Had this Friar married, hee might have died with his head upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>Upon the laſt good Friday, which I ſaw in <hi>Spain;</hi> the upper part of a Church fell, ſtanding in a Town, not far diſtant from us. And, as the manner is the women ſitting in the body of the Church, many of them were oppreſſed. The Preacher, ſeeing it when it firſt yielded, turned to go downe: (the Pulpit was joyned to a ſide pillar:) but he was beaten down, and loſt the uſe of both
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152599:93"/> his legs. The noiſe went preſently abroad, and brought in, all ſorts of people. And, the women wearing many Rings, they pulled them off, and where they came not at the firſt pull, cut off their fingers, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were alive, and onely ſtunnied. And preſently came downe another part of the roof, and deſtroyed them, and their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.

                        <hi>Lord of glory.</hi> But hee doth not meane, that the Lord of glory was crucified. For, the nature of the Deitie is not paſſible; neither is glory lyable to pain: As likewiſe, it is ſaid, <hi>No man goeth up into heaven, but he that came downe from Heaven, the Sonne of Man.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding, it was onely the Son of God, that came down from Heaven: for he was not yet, the Son of Man. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect therefore, of the perſonall Unitie in Chriſt, the things which are proper to God, are ſometimes referred to man: and the things, which pertaine to man, are aſcribed to the Divinity.

With what a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy finger, the holy Evangeliſts touch every particular ſtring, in the dolorous diſcourſe of our Saviours Paſſion? They were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men, drawn every way, with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deſires; but extraordinary perſons, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried aloft upon the wings of a divine ſpirit. For, in the relation of thoſe things, which manifeſted the glory of Chriſt, and pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the demonſtration of his God-head; they do not ſtay; they give a naked decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;

Stay there; it is too ſoone to give up the ghoſt. Father of Heaven, wilt thou ſuffer this? O all yee creatures, help, help your Creatour. But, they ſtir not; becauſe he hath bowed his head; the moſt high, and moſt majeſticall part of his body. Did hee bow his head? Hee, the great God of Heaven, and of the World; betrayed by his owne Diſciple, crucified by his owne people, led by him to the knowledge of him, when all the World was given into their own hands; and brought by a ſtrange, and a ſtrong hand, out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the houſe of bondage, the black figure of this World; into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land which flowed with milk and honey, the beautifull Embleme of Heaven? Did hee bow his head, no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but his own creatures, being uſed to his deſtruction; when the weighty ſins of the whole world were laid upon his guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe back; and when he could in one quick inſtant, have turned all the World to a vain, and fooliſh nothing? And ſhall one of us dirty creatures, frowne and be troubled, lift up the head, ſpeak raſhly, and kick againſt the thorn, moved by every ſmall, and eaſie occaſion? Shall we murmure, and trouble all with the ſmoake, and fames of angry
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152599:98"/> words? As thus, (for the deceits of the Devill are wonderfull) If that Miſcreant, that ſhape of a man, had not put my honour upon the hooke, I had not beene troubled. Such another man is not extant, me thinks, hee has not the face of an honeſt man. The carriage of his body is moſt ridiculous. God forgive me, if I think amiſſe: my heart gives mee, hee never ſays his prayers. Pray God, he believe in Chriſt. This makes the Devil ſport. What are we? How ſoone we take fire? how quickly we give fire? how long we keep fire? In what miſts, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fogs wee loſe our ſelves? Why did God ſend ſome of us now living, into the World, and not rather create us in glory; if he did not mean, we ſhould paſſe through a field of thornes, into a garden of flowers; through the Temple of Vertue, into the Temple of Honour; by pain, to pleaſure?</p>

                        <hi>HE gave up the ghoſt.</hi> They ſay, men that die, give up the ghoſt. Did Chriſt die? It cannot be. Yes: and more. He died wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, like a meeke Lambe ſobbing out his life. For, hee gave up the ghoſt; it was not taken from him. And therefore, a good man hath not feared to ſay, that Chriſt held his life by mayn ſtrength, ſome little while, beyond the date of nature; that it might
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152599:98"/> not ſeem to bee taken from him by force of armes. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay downe his life for his friends.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 13.</note> Life is the laſt of all our poſſeſſions in this World: and laying downe life, wee lay downe all: and love, that layes downe all for one, loves one better then all. It was an unſpeakable act of love, &amp; not ſufficiently utterable by the great Angels of heaven, that the moſt glorious Majeſty of God, not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pain; nor yet, able with all his power, to inflict paine upon himſelfe, ſhould come down, though not in his Majeſty, and cloſe with a body ſubject to pain: in which, hee would experimentally know al that, which man could bodily ſuffer: and more then all: for, no man ever ſuffered in ſuch a delicate conſtitution of body: and therefore, no man ever endured ſuch rage, and vehemencie of pain. O Lord, whither do'ſt thou come? we are creatures: yes truly, bodily creatures; we muſt be fed, cloathed and kept warme: we are lyable to paine, and ſhak't with a little pain, we turn colour from red to pale. Lord, the Angels, they have likewiſe fallen; and their nature is more noble; as being free from groſſe, and earthy matter. What ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee to put thy ſelfe in the livery of our fraile nature? thy love, thy will, thy moſt loving will. Looke upon him, ô my ſoule,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152599:99"/> thou daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> look upon thy dear Friend, who died temporally, that thou mayeſt live eternally; and who, out of his ſingular tenderneſſe, would not ſuffer thee to burn in Hell, for a hundred yeeres, and then recover thee; by which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he might have more imprinted in thee, the bleſſed memory of a Redeemer: but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly required in his Articles, that if thou wouldeſt cleave to the benefit of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou ſhouldeſt never come there: now look upon him. Hee hangs upon the Croſſe, all naked, all torne, all bloudie; betwixt heaven &amp; earth, as if he were caſt out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and alſo, rejected by earth: betwixt two thieves, but above them, <hi>tanquam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put latronum,</hi> as the Prince of thieves: hee has a Crown indeed, but ſuch a one, as few men will touch, no man will take from him; and if any raſh man will have it, hee muſt teare haire, skin and all, or it will not come: his haire is all clodded with bloud; his face clouded with blacke and blue; his eyes, almoſt ſunk in the ſwelling of his face: his mouth opens haſtily for breath, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve decaying nature: the veins of his breſt riſe beyond themſelves; and the whole breſt riſes and fals, while the pangs of death doe revell in it. Behold: hee ſtretcheth out his armes to imbrace his Perſecutors; and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152599:99"/> they naile them to the Croſſe, that he cannot imbrace them. Look you: hee ſets one leg before another, with a deſire of comming to them: and they naile his legs together; that he cannot come. Now truſt mee hee is all over, ſo pittifully rent—: I wil think the reſt. My ſoule, this, Chriſt did for thee: and this, Chriſt would have done for thee; if thou hadſt been the onely Sinner, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his help. What a grievous miſchiefe, is ſin? by which, this great, great? I have not words: moſt great, moſt glorious paſſion of Chriſt, is trod under foot, and ſpoiled of the latitude of its effect: and which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Jews of Chriſtians. For, by ſin Chriſt is every day crucifyed by mee; every day forced to bow his head, and give up the ghoſt. I have farther to goe. If from the price, and qualitie of the medicine, wee may in reaſon, draw arguments, to prove the ſtate, and condition of the ſoare: Sin is indeed, a grievous wound: I never heard of ſuch another. <hi>Agnoſce, ô homo,</hi> ſaith Saint<note place="margin">S.

And then, let us humbly dedicate our parts that have ſinned, to his ſervice. For doubtleſſe, hee that ſuffered <hi>Magdalene</hi> to wipe his feet with her hair, ſo often kemb'd, ſweetned, tied up in knots, let downe in books, and ſpread in Nets, to catch the careleſſe youth of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; will not reject you, or mee; or yours or mine. Hee that hath feet, which have beene <hi>ſwift to ſhed bloud,</hi> and quicke in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the acts of ſinne, let him kiſſe theſe feet, and beg part of the ſatisfaction, which they have made for the ſinnes of the feet: hee that hath hands, dipped in bloud, and bathed in all the ſinks of miſchiefe; let him kiſſe theſe hands, and beg part of the ſatisfaction, which they have made for the ſins of the hands: hee that hath ſet the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his curious eyes, wide open to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and never ſhut them againſt vaine, and wanton fights, let him kiſſe theſe eyes: hee that hath eares, bliſtred with ſlanders, and blurred with foule diſcourſes, let him kiſſe theſe eares: he that hath a mouth, <hi>plenum amaritudine,</hi> full of bitterneſſe, <hi>delibutum mendaciis,</hi> bedaub'd with lyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152599:103"/> with oaths; let him kiſſe this mouth, and beg part of the ſatisfaction, which this mouth hath made for the ſins of the mouth: he that hath a heart fraught with ill habits, and alwayes at worke in hammering ſinne, let him kiſſe, not with his lips, but with his heart, this wounded ſide; and a mingled drop of bloud and water, from this royall heart, ſhall meet the lips of his heart; while hee beggeth part of the ſatisfaction, which this heart hath made for the ſinnes of the heart. Come all, the dying man refuſeth no living man; you beggar with the crutch, come forward; no man, woman, or childe is excepted from the fruit of his paſſion. Every one, that is endued with a reaſonable ſoule, hath title to it. It is only required, that we believe in him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; (for we ought likewiſe, to give evidence of our faith, by our works.) It is Chriſtian doctrine, which Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſſe; even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up: that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternall life.</hi> Saint <hi>Leo</hi> ſtrikes home: <hi>Effuſio pro injuſtis ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis</hi>

Who then, can deſpaire? He permitted himſelfe to be faſtned to the Croſſe, to proclame, that he could not run away from any man. Preſs on boldly, hee cannot ſtirre. His feet are ſure, and therefore, you may be ſure, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run away: Nor can he free his feet with his hands, for the hands are as ſure as the feet. And if hee were looſe hands and feet, poore wounded man, he could not go farre; for, he is now parting with all the bloud in his body. And when hee does withdraw himſelfe from thoſe that call upon him, it is onely, that he may give them opportunity to call more earneſtly, and that hee may be, more honoured.

I will ſtrike my breſt with the Publican, and cry to my ſelfe; Remember alwayes, when thou art brooding ſinne in thy heart, that then thou art breeding a moſt bloody, and ſtubborne intention to kill Chriſt; and that thou, bloudy man, doeſt to the full extent of thy power, actually kill him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou art a murderer, a murderer of Chriſt: and it is a wonder, that as thou paſſeſt in the ſtreets, the ſtones doe not cry out from under thee, ſtop, ſtop the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; ſtop the man, that kill'd his Maſter, his Lord, his Redeemer, his Father, his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:152599:106"/> King, his God, and all at a blow. Goe thy wayes, ungratefull world; thou haſt loſt a jewell, of the ſight of which, thou wert not worthy. Good God, how naked the world is, now Chriſt is out of it? for when he was in it, it was very full. O my ſpirit, ſince he is gone, ſolace thy ſelfe with his memory; and being dead, let him live in thee; in thy thoughts, in thy diſcourſe, in thy actions; he will be very ſweet company. And my ſpirit, goe with mee a little. Chriſt being dead, it is pitty, but he ſhould have a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Let the Uſurer come firſt, with his bags of money, and diſtribute to the poore as he goes. The drunkard ſhall follow with the ſpunge, filled with gall and vinegar, in his hand; and check his wanton thirſt. Then the young Gallant, barefoot-like his maſter; and with the crowne of thornes upon his head. Then the factious and angry perſon, in the ſeameleſſe coat; and carrying the Croſſe upon his ſhoulders. The wanton perſon ſhall beare the rods, and whips, wherewith his Maſter was ſcourged; and fright his fleſh, The ambitious man ſhall goe clad in the purple roabe. The proud Magiſtrate follow, with the reed in his hand. The twelve Apoſtles ſhall beare up the corps with one hand; and with the other, beare every one, the inſtrument of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152599:106"/> his owne death. And the bleſſed virgin ſhal goe after, ſighing, weeping, and at every other pace, looking up to Heaven. Then <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> divided betwixt love and ſorrow, with a box of pretious oyntment in her hand; and with her haire hanging rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, if need were, to wipe his feet againe. Then <hi>Lazarus</hi> with his winding ſheet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his neck. And the lame men, whom Chriſt cured, carrying their idle crutches under their armes. And the blind, with the boyes that led them, comming after them. And then, the great ſtreame of devout peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall follow, with ſongs of victory over ſinne, death, and hell. And all the mourners ſhall goe, bowing their heads, and looking, as if they were at hand, to give up the Ghoſt, for the name of Chriſt. Hee ſhall not bee buried without a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the Text ſhall bee, <hi>The good ſhepheard giveth his life for the ſheepe.</hi> And<note place="margin">Ioh. 10 11.</note> in the end of the Sermon, (not if the time will permit, but whether the time will permit, or not) the Preacher ſhall take occaſion, to ſpeake a word or two, in the praiſe of the dead party; and ſay: that being God above all Gods, hee became man beneath all men, the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to make peace betwixt God and Man: that he was of a moſt ſweet nature; and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152599:107"/> that when he ſpoke, hee began ordinarily, with <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you:</hi> that hee was a vertuous man, a good liver; for, he never ſinned in all his life; either in thought, word, or work: that hee did many good deeds; for, being endued with the power of working miracles, he lovingly employed it in curing the lame and the blinde; in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out devils; in healing the ſick; in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the dead to life; and that hee dyed a bleſſed death; for, being unjuſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, mocked, ſpat upon, crucified, and by thoſe whom he came to redeeme from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments; hee took all patiently, and dyed praying for his perſecutors; leaving to them, when hee had no temporall thing to give, a bleſſing for a legacie. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being ended, and the buriall finiſhed; every mourner ſhall goe home, and begin a new life in the imitation of Chriſt; who choſe a poore, and miſerable life, when hee had his full choyce of all the lifes in the world. And Lord, teach mee to goe after him in his ſteps, at leaſt with poverty of ſpirit.</p>

                  <p>BEing deepe in the conſideration of Chriſts paſſion, and of the worth, and all-ſufficiency of it: I will declare my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in one point. I beleeve, that man may merit: and I beleeve, that men wonder, I beleeve it: I ſhall not eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clasp from this opinion. Still, I beleeve that man may merit. Doe you aske mee, what? Hell, and damnation (give leave to the tearme;) not Heaven, or the glory of it. But, if we merit hell, why not Heaven? The reaſon offereth it ſelfe: we merit Hell by doing ill, and wee in our owne perſons, are the onely Authors of ill: Sinne is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten betwixt the malice, and corruption of our owne wills: But he, that is ſaid to merit heaven, is likewiſe ſuppoſed to merit it by well-doing, that is, by the ſolid acts of Chriſtian vertues: and the faire exerciſe of ſuch vertues, proceedeth, not from us, being <hi>ſonnes of wrath;</hi> but from grace in Chriſt Jeſus. And therefore, by what Art can we merit, when that, by which we are thought to merit, is not wrought, and accompliſhed by us; but by the ſtrong, and over-ſwaying force of a ſuperiour power; not forcing our will to a good action, but ſweetly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152599:108"/> drawing both to it, and through it. <hi>Ate habeo,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin, quicquid boni habeo:</hi>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152599:108"/> importeth, howſoever they crutch it up handſomly; cannot be ſpoke without a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loeciſme, both in phraſe, and beliefe. The man committed a Soloeciſme, that looked and pointed towards earth, when he ſpoke of Heaven. And true Chriſtian humility ought, even to ſpeake humbly. But even the doctrine of the Papiſts is bold, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous. Thoſe habits of vertues (ſay they) which God, the Lord of all ſpirituall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, infuſeth into the ſoule, are produced by God without us, or our ayde, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation: but the acts of thoſe habits, that is, the exerciſes of vertue, are ſo produced by Grace in us, that wee alſo, muſt freely and readily concurre, if we meane to put a price upon them, and make them meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their production. But the will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth not, except enabled with actuall grace; and the childe, I meane the action that is borne, altogether reſembleth grace, as it is a vertuous action; and they will not call it a meritorious action, but as vertuous; and therefore, the merit belongs to Grace, not to our wills, or us; and partly, to the grace, by the motion of which, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with grace. And it is the opinion of the prime Divines amongſt them, that a work, though very good and honeſt, and true gold; if performed without any paine
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152599:109"/> and difficulty; if mingled with no gall, no wormwood; may indeed, merit certaine degrees of bleſſedneſſe; but ſhall in no wiſe be ſatisfactory. For, as it is proper (ſay theſe Doctors) to a good work, in reſpect of the goodneſſe and honeſty of it, to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious: ſo it is made proper alſo, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law; to a painfull, and toilſome work, to render ſatisfaction for ſinne committed. And thus, they both ſatisfie for their ſinnes, which merited hell, and by a ſurpluſſage of goodneſſe, merit Heaven. And very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the roughneſſe &amp; aſperity, with which God handles them, is greater (they tell us) then the ſatisfaction, due on their part: which falling betwixt God and man, drops into his Treaſury of Indulgences, whom they make halfe a God, and halfe a man; there to lye in the ſame roome, with <hi>the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious redemption</hi> of Chriſt; and be conferred, when, and to whom, his Holineſſe ſhall pleaſe; who, having two Treaſuries, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome gives out of one, but hee takes into the other. They ſeeme to ſtand upon very even tearmes with God, or rather, to goe beyond him; and yet, he hath beene alwayes obſerved, to reward above good, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh beneath evill. How does the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hold, that we are <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> if wee ſatisfie in a fit kinde, for what wee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:152599:109"/> have done; and if wee ſatisfie, both for our ſelves, and others? Here is a faire, and rich harveſt of profit. If ſatisfaction can be wrought by a man, why did not God ſpare his Sonne, and ſend a creature to dye for us? I doe not leane with my whole body, upon this argument. Here is the pillar, &amp; it is one of <hi>Hercules</hi> his pillars, beyond which, we cannot goe: That could not be effected by a creature, becauſe it was the great, and generall payment of ſatisfaction; and God required, the ſatisfaction to be true, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: but this, in their opinion, can: and therefore, it cannot take the name of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, without obligation to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt: and to ſhare the titles, and immunities of Chriſts paſſion with him, is a ſtrange kind of pride; from which, Chriſt for ever hereafter, defend my ſoule. It is confeſſed, that the merit of Chriſt, is merit in the rigour of Juſtice, becauſe it taketh it's worth, and nobility from the dignity of the perſon; and therefore, ſtands not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and with both feet, upon the favour of him that accepts it. But the merit of man, cannot oblige God to give a reward. For, God naturally, hath no obligation, to make retribution to a creature. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſay, hee hath ſtruck the ſtroke, and made a bargaine, by which, hee hath bound
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:152599:110"/> himſelfe to retribution: and this bargaine ſtanding in force, our reward is due by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: this truly, is the pretious fruit of the divine liberality, and the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus, whom <hi>Syneſius</hi> calleth, <hi>viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ingentium partum,</hi> the birth of huge<note place="margin">Syneſ. in hymnis.</note> bowells: who ſatisfying the infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of an infinite God, for the commiſſion of ſinne, an infinite evill; the cauſe urged, that the merit alſo, ſhould be infinite. And if we compare his works, being of infinite valour, with our works; betwixt finite and infinite there is a great (ſome ſay an infinite) diſtance; all ſay, no proportion. Hath God took all the wayes, that invention can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly compaſſe, to make up his full domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over man; and to hold, and turne all his faculties, by a little ſtring at his pleaſure: to lay him low, and make him ſupple, to take the print of Humility? and ſhall hee now merit in any ſenſe, not onely, a particular bleſſing, be it ſpirituall or temporall; but all that, which God profeſſeth, hee hath to give, Heaven and happineſſe; and our ſound and ſweet ſleepe in his ſoft armes, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more? It would be a fooliſh paſſage of the worme, and it would deſerve to be trod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if it ſhould ſeeke to goe with it's long traine upwards: and it is not ſutable with earth, to deſire the high place of Heaven.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152599:110"/> No pride is halfe ſo injurious to Gods high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as when wee are proud of ſpirituall Graces. And the reaſon is good mettall: The gifts of nature, as, health, ſtrength, the readineſſe of the ſenſes; although they are Gods gifts, yet are they naturally due, and proper to the body: but the gifts of grace, are by no law due to the ſoule; for, a man is compleat in the ſtate of a man, without Grace: and Grace, if not of free gift, is not Grace: and therefore, to be proud of them, is eſpecially grievous; becauſe wee are proud of thoſe things, which are altogether heavenly, and which wholly belong to the King himſelfe, and which hee beſtoweth with his owne hands, and which hee moſt freely giveth, and which hee hath ſet his owne armes upon, (for, the leaſt degree of grace beares the likeneſſe of God, and his holineſſe) to move in us an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, as the true, and onely giver. Let S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſpeak, for hee ſpeaks to God. <hi>Quiſquis tibi numerat merita ſua, quid tibi numerat, niſi munera tua?</hi> Whoſoever num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth<note place="margin">S. Aug. in Confeſ.</note> to thee his own merits, what doth he number to thee, but thy owne gifts? In his time, the bold uſe of the word, merit, taught vaine people to number their merits, in the preſence of God, and to his very face. And many hundreds of yeares after, even
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:152599:111"/> the Councell of Trent, forced to deny their owne word, in the ſenſe, and power of it; ſaid of God, <hi>Cujus tanta eſt erga omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>

Away then, with the ſcandalous phraſe of ſpeaking. It is a wiſe fiſh, which preſaging a ſtorme, faſtneth it ſelfe upon a rock. Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is the rock, and upon him will I fix my ſoule; and ſing with S. <hi>Bernard, Meritúm meum, miſerationes Domini,</hi> The mercies of<note place="margin">S.

And yet, they had gained ſuch an eſtimation of ſanctity, that they were famous for it; but all, by impoſtures. For, they would hang betwixt heaven and earth in the ſight of their Novices; as if they were caught up from the ground in a rapture, or extaſie, and ſo full fraught with heavenly thoughts, that their ſoules putting themſelves on with much vehemency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, and aſſiſted with Gods help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, carried their bodies along with them. And their holy Nun of <hi>Carion,</hi> as I have bin enformed by a Traveller of worth, is proved to have beene a Witch. Their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Nun of <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> which gave her bleſſing to the old Spaniſh Fleet, lying there at anchor; dyed, confeſſing, ſhe had lived a Witch: and yet, they report, that the wall of her cloiſter, would commonly open of it ſelfe, and the Sacrament, <hi>the King of glory,</hi> paſſe through it, borne by no viſible thing, into her mouth. One thing I moſt highly deteſt, amongſt them; that, in their proceſſions on <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, they act Playes, full of moſt prophane, and baſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſtuffed with moſt ridiculous paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; in the wayes where the Sacrament is brought, both before, and after it paſſeth:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152599:112"/> and yet, their Players being of both ſexes, are moſt wicked, and excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And at other times, when the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is expoſed in the Churches; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Clownes come, trim'd up, and with their beſt clothes on, and dance by the high Altar before it; in imitation of <hi>David,</hi> that danced before the Ark; and the people ſtand about them, as they doe in our Country Townes at their Summer ſports: only, the Altar-ſide is cleare. And whereas the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were infected with an evill cuſtome, of giving reprochfull names one to another, as they met occaſionally in the high-wayes: the Pope hath taught them a Salutation, and bound a ſufficient Indulgence to it, <hi>Alabado ſea el ſantiſſimo ſacramento,</hi> Praiſed be the moſt holy Sacrament; which words they uſually pronounce one to another, as they meet.

For, what is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at this day, in the mouth, I cannot ſay, of an uncircumciſed, but of an unbeleeving Turk; when hee mingleth diſcourſe with a Chriſtian concerning God, and Religion; then to ſay in a reproachfull manner, Alas good man, I pitty you, you make your God, that which I eat at my Table? And this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though it be drawne but <hi>ab improbabili,</hi> yet urges: becauſe, beſides that nothing is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152599:113"/> improbable which is; God hath ordained probability to be one of the firſt ſteps to knowledge. If wee goe to the Univerſity, and ask the Philoſophers: they will tell us, it is requiſite to the nature, and Eſſence of a body, that every part ſhould have his proper place: neither can a body be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be a compleat body, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive diſtinction of parts; or to be, but in a place. And it is the exigence of materiall Accidents, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as of quantity, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, colour; to be rooted in a body. But here, they are ſuppoſed to ſtand by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without a prop. And when a reaſon of theſe things, never thought of in any kind of learning, either in themſelves, or in their grounds, is required; the greateſt ſchollers in the world on their part, can ſay nothing, but, wee muſt goe up with holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> the good old man, to the top of the mountaine: who, having a ſtrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that his ſeed ſhould be multiplyed as the ſtarres of Heaven; was yet, commanded to kill, and ſacrifice his onely ſonne <hi>Iſaak:</hi> and we muſt leave the ſervants, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Aſſe at the foot of the hill; that is, the ſenſes, and Reaſon. But, if the ſenſes be ſervants, they are faithfull ones, and are not deceived in the knowledge of their proper objects; due order, and conditions being
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152599:113"/> kept on both ſides: and if Reaſon be an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Aſſe, what diſtinction is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a man, and a beaſt? They ſpeake on: As the Captaines of the Army, put off their garments, laid them in a heap, and ſetting <hi>Jehu</hi> upon them, cryed, <hi>Jehu</hi> is King: So we building a Throne for Faith over Senſe and Reaſon, muſt hold up our hands, and pray, that Faith may have a long, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous raigne over us, <hi>Vive la Foy,</hi> long live Faith.

I yeeld, that in the part of Divinity, which treateth of the bleſſed Trinity, Reaſon muſt ſtrike ſaile, and ſtoope: and Reaſon teacheth us, that in the ſcanning of ſuch high things, Reaſon muſt be guided by a more certaine,

Anſwer mee now: Doth it not follow, and flow out of theſe principles: that the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, hath the being of a body, and the being of a ſpirit at the ſame time? and that, if an Angell ſhould take a particle of the Hoaſt, and divide it continually for all eternity; becauſe ſuch a diviſion can never ſtrike ſomething to nothing, as likewiſe no creature can ever lift ſomething from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſtill in that little thing, very like to nothing, and many thouſands of yeares before, not perceptible by any ſenſe of man, Chriſt ſhall be as truly, and as plentifully preſent, as hee was in the world, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe? Anſwer mee againe: Doe not they worſhip, as Chriſt ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, they know not what?</hi> For, when the Prieſt is ſuppoſed to be a<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 22.</note> Prieſt, and is not; which often happeneth according to their Divinity, either for the defect of Baptiſme, or for want of intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

And it is a fearefull thing, to draw the chiefe, and moſt noble acts of Religion, within the liſts of ſuch notable danger. And the law of not adminiſtring the Sacrament in both kinds, being one of the young hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, which wait upon this doctrine took earneſt firſt, in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> And Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> curſed all thoſe, who preſumed to maime the divine ordinance, and to receive it, onely in one kinde.

By great chance, there came to my hands, a Booke, called <hi>Regulae Societatis Ieſu,</hi> The Rules of the Jeſuits: which Booke, they have not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152599:115"/> formerly ſuffered to be printed, but onely, in the Jeſuits Colledge at <hi>Rome.</hi> And this Book, their Superiours alone, make uſe of, and are permitted to have. It containeth in part, a ſtrange kinde of direction, how to ſquare, and faſhion their Novices, in the time of their two yeares Noviſhip; and eſpecially, how to ſift them, and ſearch into their lifes, and natures, at their firſt entrance. The quick, and angry diſpoſition moſt pleaſes them: becauſe in perſons, owing ſuch diſpoſitions, all the paſſions are more lively, and ſtirring. How alſo, to diſpoſe of their young-men in the divers wayes of their naturall inclinations: and how to deale with them, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tempers; and chiefely, if they begin to look another way; and to lean from them. And how, when they ſend Letters from houſe to houſe, to mark them with private ſtamps in the inſide; leſt the character go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, ſhould bee counterfeit: with many more cunning pleats of Jeſuiticall government. And it is one of their daily brags, that they live under Rule; we, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rule. But, were their Rules ſeaſoned with more Chriſtianity, and leſſe policie; they would be more Chriſtian. My Reader ſhall have his Rules likewiſe, and live under them, if he pleaſe. Thus much before I begin.

For as a habit is gained, and<note place="margin">Pſal 34. 14</note> ſtrengthened by a frequent repetition, and multiplication of Acts, which are of the ſame ſtampe, and colour with the habit; as a habit of ſwearing is gained, and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by ſwearing often: ſo it is abated by diſturbing, and aboliſhed by deſtroying the courſe of ſuch acts; as a habit of ſwearing is abated, and aboliſhed by him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often ſworne, now ſeldome, or never ſweareth. It is not one, or a few acts, which generate a habit: nor a ſmall ceſſation from them which utterly corrupts it. And therefore, Children, entring upon the firſt yeare of knowledge, and diſcretion, plant vertuous habits, with great eaſe in their ſouls; and with much more facilitie, then people, whoſe yeeres, and ſinnes are many; though much enabled with knowledge, wiſdome and experience.

And when you goe to dinner, or to bed, or turne to the acts and exerciſes of your Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; begin all with a cleane and pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, for the love and honour of GOD. And even the naturall work, to which, your nature is vehemently carried, and by which, you gaine temporally; being turned towards the true Loadſtone, and put in the way to Gods glory; doth riſe above nature, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it ſelfe; and is much more gainfull ſpiritually: as being performed, not becauſe it is agreeable with your deſire, but becauſe it is conformable to the divine will. And often, in the performance, and execution of the worke (if it require a long continuance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152599:119"/> of action) renew; and if need bee, recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſmooth, and poliſh your intention; for being neglected, it quickly groweth crooked. And when you are called to a difficult work, or a work, that lyes thwart, and ſtrives againſt the current of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination; dignifie, and ſweeten it often, with the comfortable remembrance of your moſt noble end. And whereas wee are openly commanded, ſo cloſely to carrie the good deeds of the right hand, that the left hand be not of the Counſell: and again, to turn ſo much of our ſelves outward, that our light may ſhine before men: it is in our duty to obſerve the <hi>Golden Mean,</hi> and keep the middle way betwixt the two Rocks. Carry an even hand betvvixt your concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your good vvorks, and your being a light to others. You muſt not conceale all, neither muſt you ſhine onely. Hide the inward; but ſhew the outward, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, nor with a ſiniſter intention to the left hand; but to GOD; and thoſe that will bee edified. Every Vertue ſtandeth betwixt two extreames, and yet, toucheth neither: whereof the one offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in exceſſe; the other, in defect. The one is too couragious; the other is over-dull, but under the Vertue. Now the Devill deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth much to ſhew himſelfe, not in his own
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:152599:119"/> likeneſſe, but in that extream, which is like, and more nigh to the Vertue, or at leaſt, to the appearance of it; as Prodigalitie is more like to Liberalitie, then Covetouſneſſe. God hath true Saints, and true Martyrs; which are both inſide, and outſide. The Devill hath falſe Saints, and falſe Martyrs; which are all outſide, like his fairneſſe. As Prudence, is the Governeſſe of all Vertues, ſo principally of Devotion.</p>

And yet, you may not judge the perſon, or decide the doubt; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe guided with a cleere, and certaine knowledge of evill. Wherefore, ſuſpend your judgment, and gather up your minde into it ſelfe. One branch is yet wanting to this advertiſement. You muſt continually ſtand waking, and watching over your thoughts: for the fit ordering of our thoughts within us, and of our ſenſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, will certainly keepe us from all diſtraction, and from all occaſions of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide, in our way towards Chriſt. And therefore, upon every ſally, or incurſe of Temptation; turne quickly, from the ſuggeſtion, and repreſentation of it. Then humbly acknowledge your own weakneſſe, and call earneſtly upon God for help. And lay up ſafe in your minde, that every ſhew, and repreſentation of evill in our heart, is not evill to us; except it be ſeconded on our part, either with a full, and abſolute conſent; or with a weak, hanging, and half-conſent; or with complacence: or except you did wilfully thruſt your ſelfe upon the neer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152599:122"/> of ſuch repreſentations. For, the divine Law commandeth us, to avoid even the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſin. And he, that wilfully touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the neere, and catching occaſion; or openeth a little private doore to ſin, or to the pleaſures that wait upon it, as it were dallying, and ſporting with them; is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tooke with ſome odde picture in the repreſentation; by which engaged, he goeth on, and ſtill on, and a little farther on: till he is ſwallowed up at laſt, into the great and deep Gulf of ſin.

At two doores Almighty God doth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand, and call us to him: at the inward doore of the ſoul, and at the outward doore of the ſenſe: inwardly, by his holy inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and outwardly, by his holy Word, and Preachers; though indeed, the inward calling is more frequent. For, to ſpeak with a Councell, <hi>Nec momentum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem praeterit, in quo Deus non ſtat ad oſtium, &amp; pulſat,</hi> A moment of time doth not paſſe,<note place="margin">Conc.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152599:122"/> our hearts, and earneſtly knocks for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. To this end, take ſpeciall notice of the calls, illuminations, and inſpirations, which daily you have from Heaven. Which calls, and inſpirations you may either total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject, or obey either in part, or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their full extent and amplitude. <hi>If thou wilt bee perfect,</hi> goe through all, which the inſpiration commandeth. If the inſpiration pronounce abſolutely, follow me; doe not confine him, that neither can be limited in himſelfe, nor will be limited in his commands, to a certain compaſſe; and deſire to goe firſt, and bury thy Father; loſt the call coole, and the inſpiration be loſt in the crowde of other occaſions. You ſhall diſcern an Inſpiration from a Temptation, by the lawfulneſſe of the action, to which you are moved; and of the end. Take heed therefore, of committing evill, under the faire, goodly, and godly pretence of a good end.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152599:123"/> thoſe eſpecially, which are tempered with the ſweets of comfort, from his neereſt and deareſt friends. And then there will ſeeme to be a continuall night in their hearts; they will be very dry, and deſolate; as receiving no drop of ſenſible dew from Heaven; I meane, of ſpirituall comfort, which glads the heart. And the Tempter will ſay, and often ſay, they are forſaken of God. This, the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth: Firſt, for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, &amp; triall. You may reply: why for our triall? God knoweth alreadie, what wee are able to doe, and above this, what wee will doe, put upon a triall. It is ſo.

The diſcourſe of the Mouth, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Trumpet, is but like the talk of a common Souldier; a rapſodie of brags, and boaſting.

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>to them who are the called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> The ſufficient, and efficacious helps of God, in this onely differing; that helped ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently wee do not, becauſe wee will not work; helped efficaciouſly, wee doe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that his preſence when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, ſhould be more eſteemed. If day ſhould alwayes continue; the Light and the Sun would not be thought ſo faire, as they are: But becauſe Day commeth and goeth,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152599:124"/> ſheweth his face, and then, turneth aſide; Night ſtepping betwixt day and day, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to value a benefit by the abſence of it. And thus it is, in our outward affaires; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Adverſitie, making day and night in the life of Man. Thirdly, leſt wee ſhould vainly thinke, that Gods lights, and inſpirations are due to us; and that wee have true title to them, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of them: and leſt wee ſhould be proud of the comfort; and believe, that it comes tributarie to us, or as a payment for our ſervice of God. Laſtly, leſt wee ſhould love God more for the comfort, then for himſelf. And ſeriouſly, there is much droſſe in the matter, when we are always comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our prayers; for, the comfort is acted in the ſenſuall part of the ſoule. Yet, at our firſt comming to God, and in our converſion to him, hee doth cheriſh us with many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall comforts, which ſtay long with us; becauſe wee came lately out of the World, all cold and torne; and there is now, more need of heat: Now, we are little children, and muſt be moved to goe, ſpeake, and aske bleſſing with Sugar, and with Delicates; and there is now, ſome need of dandling, and of Songs, to make the childe ſmile. As alſo, when God ſetteth forward, ſitting in the midſt of his judgements, towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152599:124"/> he beginneth with foft, and fair means; as wee likewiſe ought, in all our dealings: ſhewing to the life, that Gentleneſſe is a property, moſt proper to him; as taking place, &amp; iſſuing firſt out, upon all occaſions.</p>
                     <p>To cloſe up this Rule: By any means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not the execution of inſpirations, now made intentions. Neither change Gods inſpiration, for a new intention of your own making; though ſeemingly good, and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For, though it be good in it ſelfe; it is not good enough, put in ballance with the pure, and heavenly inſpiration: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, God ſees that your eternall ſalvation (this is a high point) depends upon your carriage in the uſe, or abuſe of that inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I ſuppoſe, it pointeth to ſome high mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Devill hath learned it, of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge; which, ſeeing a man neer to her neſt, and apprehending danger, riſeth a little, and putteth forward with a weake and ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring flight: then preſently, tumbleth to the ground, as if there were a fault in one of her wings. Thus again, and again, and perhaps, againe: And playeth the counterfeit; till having tempted without the helpe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the reaſonable creature from her neſt, ſhee proveth ſuddenly, and ſtrangely reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of her hurt, and flyeth ſtrongly away. Thus the Devill will cunningly winde you
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:152599:125"/> out of one good intention, into another, not ſo good, or not ſo good for you, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him that knows you: draw you on, and on; ſtep, after ſtep; with great varietie of wittie and pretty excuſes, till at laſt, the plot gives, and you behold your ſelf naked, and wrought miſerably out of all. Hee would be a mad Devill, if he ſhould tempt from very fair, to very foule. But hee hath a very good wit of his own, though hee doth not uſe it well: hee is a notable workman, and forgeth choice, and curious pretences. A malicious man, as big with poyſon, as the Spider; will commonly ſay: Intruth, I do not intend to endamage my Neighbour (far be that from mee:) he, and I have beene old acquaintance, I knew his Father well: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire onely, to ſave my ſelfe; and with all, to make him know himſelfe; to humble him, as God humbleth ſinners, no otherwiſe; out of meere charity: others will be good ſebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and great Proficients by this example; I ſhall doe a world of good. And thus, other evill doers. Now, your end is indeed, evill: but you have pull'd a very good end or two, and thoſe but imaginary, over it. And the evill end lieth hid in the bottome; that in your heat, and while the matter is upon the Anvile, and hot in the hammering, you ſcarce know your own end, your ſelfe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:152599:125"/> the thoughts be white, and of a faire skin, that beget the action immediatly, and neerely; yet the remote thoughts may ſometimes be the Authors of it, and the other, but putative &amp; ſuppoſititious. Though the Father and Mother bee white, if the Grandfather was an Ethiopian, the childe is ſometimes black.</p>

If he be, he can ſtirre, and turne you, as he pleaſeth: and it is your daily care, to give him full content, and ſatisfaction. If you love God, he loveth you; for his love is alwayes the firſt Mover; and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152599:128"/> from his love of you, that you love him. Indeed, God loveth his Enemies, as we likewiſe, ought to doe: but his enemies doe not love him; neither doth he love his enemies intimately, and familiarly, as hee doth his friends. For, there is little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, little communication, (which is both the exerciſe, and recreation of love) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God, and his enemies. You love God truly, if prompted by the love of him, you preferre him, and his law, in all caſes, in all cauſes: and when you rightly fit, and order the acts of your election; not giving place to creatures, or ſins, (which as they are ſinnes, are not creatures) before God; and in a manner, deifie them. It would be ſtrange above ordinary, and extraordinary; that God ſhould command me to love him, and ſtirred by this love, to keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and moreover, to give thanks continually, for the ſpirituall good, which by his grace, he worketh in me: and yet, I ſhould never be able to know, when I, or others did love God; though perhaps, it might prove a knot in reſpect of others. And certainly, he that loveth God truly, is highly in his favour. For the true love of God, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually containeth Repentance, in which, the ſoule is united by Grace to God; and the love of God it ſelfe, is nothing but a cloſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:152599:129"/> Union of the ſoule with God. And, that I may raiſe my diſcourſe to an infinite height, The holy Ghoſt, being the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, is a firme knitting of them together.</p>

And ſay, I would, no man had ever ſinned, did now ſinne, or would ſinne hereafter: And for you, that love God, goe on with comfort, double the heat of your affection towards him, and let the burden of the ſong ſtill be, <hi>O God, I love thee.</hi> But beware, that in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſinner, you doe not hate the man, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſinner. Hate ſinne in it ſelfe, and alſo, hate it in ſuch a perſon, but hate not the perſon. You ought to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion betwixt the marrow, and the bones: love the men, but hate their manners. For thy enemies, <hi>hate them with a perfect hate,</hi> and let the higheſt point of thy ſorrow be, that they are enemies to God, &amp; that in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemies to thee, they crook thee to their devices, &amp; uſe thee to forward them upon the downfall of eternall damnation. It is a ſinne, as black as the devill, to hate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; if we doe not ſeparate, and diſtinguiſh the object of our hate, from God's white creature in the devill. Yet, make a broad difference betwixt the imperfections of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:152599:130"/> men, and their foule enormities. Beare the burden of another's imperfections, <hi>for ſo thou ſhalt fulfill the law of Chriſt,</hi> and move God, and thy neighbour, to beare with thee. In a preſſe of people, one giveth way to the other: Bricks are made ſquare, to lay the pavement even. God's deareſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have their imperfections, and their skarres, even in their faces; that they may be humble, and acknowledge themſelves to bee what they are: which imperfections are, as it were, the droſſe, and earth of the ſoule. And yet, wee may not conſort with knowne, and profeſſed ſinners.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſter is not true to his Religion, that is a ſilent Companion of Popiſh Prieſts: and it is not a good ſigne, or ſymptome, that <hi>Franciſcus à Sancta Clara,</hi> alias <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> admitted him to a peruſall of his <hi>Deus, Natura, Gratia,</hi> before it was printed; and yet, he ſo farre went on with that wicked, and unworthily inſinuating Book, that hee ſuffered it to take it's courſe without a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. How can this be characterized, but <hi>A holding of Counſell with Gods enemies?</hi> He is my neighbour: but, the more holy, and more excellent Obligation may not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to ſet free, and ſave the meaner: when the one in reaſon and religion, inferres the deſtruction of the other. Hee and I are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:152599:131"/> and Paſtors are ſo called, <hi>à paſcendo,</hi> becauſe they muſt feed their flocks. Of ſtrangers, the Shepherds, being admoniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven, did firſt adore the <hi>good Shepherd:</hi> and in the time when the Shepherds watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over their flocks, news came to them of a Saviour.

                     <p>WHen you are put on by a ſtrong, and vehement deſire, towards an indifferent thing, by force bow the will another way. For in the full maſtering of the powers, and paſſions, ſtandeth abſolute mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and conſequently, true perfection. And truly, when wee deſire, or love a temporall thing above an ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, GOD doth ordinarily, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily chaſtiſe us in it, or by it, or by the want of it: becauſe it breedeth a great expence of Time; and the deſire, and love due to God, are turned upon a creature. When wee ſo love our children, that wee look over, or countenance vices in them; we are commonly puniſhed in them: they bring our gray haires with ſorrow to our graves. And likewiſe, when wee abhorre, and are wholly averted from an indifferent thing, God ſendeth it in a full ſhowre upon us: with a purpoſe to kill, and mortifie our wils, and affections. Some things, although
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152599:132"/> not evill in themſelves, may not be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired; as our own praiſe, and honour beyond the ſtraine of our condition. The love of God can never be immoderate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it can never be greater, then the thing, which is loved: and the will in loving, if it be carried directly to God, can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.</p>
                     <p>Faſt often. And if thy body be able to goe under the burthen, let not thy Faſt admit of any kind of nouriſhment. And then, aske the benefits, thou moſt deſireſt. And by the way, remember, that to faſt, as alſo to heare Sermons, are not properly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Acts, but the ready wayes to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And therefore, if the Body be not laid under the Soule, by faſting; and the Soule farthered in the practice of vertues, by hearing Sermons; no good is done, but harme in abundance: God is tempted, Time abuſed. Holy dayes are prophaned, The ſoul with God's Image, defiled; and theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts puff us up, and wee contemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as prophane perſons. The Soule is Miſtris (I ſay not, abſolute Miſtris) of the Body. And therefore, her end being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and tranſcending all other ends; to comply with it, ſhee may curbe and fubdue the body, as ſhe in reaſon pleaſeth. The Soul of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſor giveth up his Body to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152599:133"/> and the Soul of the Martyr, his body to death, and diſſolution; in the purſuit of their end. <hi>Zeno</hi> ſaith, <hi>Remorabantur in luce detenti, quorum membris pleni erant tumuli:</hi> They<note place="margin">Zeno de S. Arcadis.</note> remained alive, and converſed with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; with whoſe members, as, tongues, hands, fingers, feet, the Tombs of the dead were repleniſhed. Yet break not your body, by faſting; for ſo, you may cut it off from the fit exerciſe of Vertue, and Gods ſervice: and hee, that commands thee, not to kill thy Neighbour, will not ſuffer thee, to be thy owne murderer. Be not dejected, becauſe you are weak, and cannot perfectly maſter your Bodie; for God delighteth to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and ſhew his ſtrength in your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Strength, and weakneſſe are beſt met together. When you fall, catch hold upon God, and riſe: falling again, again riſe. Indeed, hee that goeth ſmoothly on, when all things ſmile upon him; and returneth backe, when the winde bloweth in his face; will never come to his own Countrey. And here note, that God dealeth with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and with all people, now by faire means, and now again, by foule. But it is a very ſuſpitious, and doubtfull buſineſſe, when we have more faire, and flowry way, then foule, and ſtonie: and it is very likely, that God hath now caſt off the care of us.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:152599:133"/> The badge of Proſperity is one of Death's marks. The Oxe is fed full; and fat for the Shambles. God puniſheth his beſt Servants, to wean them from the World, and to better their waight of Glory; <hi>Hee chaſtiſeth every childe, which he receiveth.</hi> And therefore, when wee ſin, and our ſin is not followed with puniſhment, but one ſinne is puniſhed with another, &amp; that other, with another; it is a moſt fearful caſe: for then God ſheweth, he hath a farther ayme, then temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. As likewiſe, when wee have no ſenſe, or feeling of our ſins, no ſpirituall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, the ſoule is dangerouſly affected.</p>

                     <p>WHen thou art ſet on fire with a Temptation of the fleſh, apply thy ſelfe inſtantly, to ſome kinde of employment: ſaying: Go Devill, now I read your baſeneſſe in a big letter: Truly, now you begin to be a meere Foole; this is plaine filthines. How ſtrangely the Divell hath beſotted, yea, bewitched men! Some love women, far inferiour both in body and minde, to their wives, whom they neglect: damping and diſcountenancing their loves. But God will perhaps puniſh them, as his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152599:134"/> manner is, with puniſhments, like to their ſins. Other wives may ſucceed, that will doat upon their Husbands Inferiours. From love, worſe then hate; and from falſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that fry with love towards other men, their Husbands yet breathing, <hi>Good Lord, deliver us.</hi> For, they are like faire, ſtrong, and heavie Cheſts, that appeare to the eye, and hang upon the hand, as if they were rich in money, plate, and jewels; but are ſtuffed only with ſtones, hay, and browne paper. As their gifts, ſo they.</p>
                     <p>The ſin of the fleſh is now more hainous, then it was before the Incarnation of Chriſt, becauſe it tainteth the fleſh, which he took, &amp; which he hath already glorified. <hi>Parce in te Chriſto,</hi> ſaith one, Spare Chriſt in thy ſelfe. And fright away the Temptation, with a loathing and execration of ſuch Beaſtlineſſe, &amp; with contempt of ſo baſe, and ſo quicke a pleaſure; accompanied with ſhame, and with ſuch a thought as this, I am a Villain; and followed with ſhame, hate, and ſorrow, much unlike Repentance.</p>
                     <p>After your Triumph over Temptation, or your eſcape from danger; run to God, the onely diſpoſer of your affaires, when they turne to vertuous Good; and give him, humble thanks. And reflect upon your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, if you had fallen under that Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:152599:134"/> or Danger. Then ſearch into the ſecret, and learn, whether you did not by ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offence, pull the Temptation, or danger upon your ſelfe; which God now uſed, as a warning. And look with a neere eye, into the deep craft of the Devill. And for the preſent; mark how painfully hee kindleth, and bloweth the coals of emulation betwixt Brethren, Siſters, Scholers, men of the ſame Trade, people living in the ſame Houſe, Neighbours, Families, Countries. How hee createth miſtakes, ſuſpitions, jealouſies, with a purpoſe to call up Anger. I wil tel you; A great Author is of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the devil doth oftentimes, ſet Dogs together by the eares, that hee may provoke men to quarrell.</p>
                     <p>By the falling out of two children, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ball, hee turned all <hi>Italy</hi> into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, wherein many thouſands loſt their pretious lifes: paſſing by degrees (as hee doth in all his Temptations) from children to men, from Parents to all of the ſame bloud, from them to friends, and from theſe friends to their friends, and their friends friends: from houſes to Cities, from Cities to Countries; and all this began from the play of two little children. I will give you a touch of his wonderfull deceits, out of my Experience: One ſeeing a dead man, and hearing the people that were preſent, ſay,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152599:135"/> it was a beautifull corps; was fired with a great Temptation, to kill himſelfe; that it might be ſaid of him likewiſe, It is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull corps. This was a vain-glorious end; now for a ſeemingly vertuous end: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would faine have killed himſelfe, that he might have revenged God's quarrell, and made an end of ſinning againſt ſo bleſſed, and ſweet a God. The devill is a great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, he hath his faire ends, and his foule ends; ends to ſhew, and ends, which hee will not ſhew; ends, that are but veyles, drawne over his ends; ends, without end; many ends for one action.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am now a Monke in <hi>Doway,</hi> and ſhaved to the Scull; as I learned of them, for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eſpecially: firſt, becauſe all Slaves were ever ſhav'd, and I was now a Slave to God, and muſt come and goe at the leaſt beck of his pleaſure. Secondly, to give me notice, that all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities muſt be cut from me, in all kindes. Thirdly, to make better roome for a Crown of glory. But there are Monkes in the ſame houſe, yet living apart from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, belonging to the rich Abbat of <hi>Arras,</hi> that are not of ſo bare a cut: and no Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier can ſet out, and make more of the haire
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152599:136"/> they have, then they doe. It is in uſe with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> both in the giving of their orders, and their degrees of orders, and initiations to orders; and alſo, in the ſtate of Epiſcopacie, and the ſtaires of it, as the Biſhop, the Arch-Biſhop, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, and the Pope, to ſhave the haire wider and wider, into a greater, and a greater cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as the perſons more dignified; and therefore the Pope is the moſt ſhaved of them all. In this Monaſtery, my diſlike grew by little and little, from theſe reaſons. That which (I feare) heated ſome of them, chilled me. For, although I was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to eate fleſh amongſt the Monkes, for the ſpace of three quarters of a yeare; yet, they ſent me plenty of fleſh, when I dined in my chamber. And I had great variety of excellent meates, both in one place, and the other. And leſt I ſhould be ſcandalized, it was ſuggeſted to me; that now mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not able to brooke faſting, as they have done. I have not loſt it out of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; that I turn'd my eye aſide one time in the end of dinner, and ſaw a Monke leaning backwards, and ſtretching out his belly, as like a Glutton as might be. I had forgot to tell you, that no King doth fare better, or is fed with more variety, then the Ieſuits in their feaſts; if we conſider how
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152599:136"/> much a man can eate. Here followes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceit of the Monkes, ſomewhat like the former. In the end of Lent, Father Prior, the head-Monke, waſhed the feete of all his inferiour Monkes, in imitation of Chriſt, who waſhed his Diſciples feete: but warning was given the day before, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was commanded to waſh and purifie his owne feete; and yet when they came to the Prior, he did ſcarce touch their feete, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his hands, or with the water; and here was all the imitation of Chriſt. Such another buſineſſe, and as like it, as an Egge is to an Egge, is acted by his Holineſſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> who is ſaid to waſh the feete of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine poore Pilgrims. The man hath not reaſon, who ſaith, theſe are any thing but the bare ſhadowes of humility. The Monks in the place of their meeting to their meales, ſpeake not; but performe all by ſignes; and they have a booke which teaches the Art of making ſignes, either by way of ſpeech, or anſwer. But this is onely an outward colour, preſented in publike. For, the Monke, whoſe onely converſation I enjoyed, of all that were ſettled in the houſe, being eſteemed one of the wiſeſt men in Chriſtendome, was full of words, and many of them were bad ones. Hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to beget in me an opinion (to which

And (ſaid this Monke) poyſon of their giving may lye gnawing inſenſibly in your body, and kill you at ſeven yeeres end. The Jeſuits may remember, they had provided a Gammon of Bacon, which I ſhould have carried with me: If it was mans meate, they have the leſſe to anſwer for. Another diſh I did eate of; the working of which, I afterwards much feared. But in that journey, the Sea cleanſed my body throughly. Of this Monke I learned, that the Pope had as deepe a hand in the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder treaſon, as the Jeſuits; and both were very deepe in it: (And the Jeſuits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo wryed, and ſo cloſely knit to the Pope by obedience, durſt not have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo high, and ſo publike an Treaſon, without his knowledge) That whoſoever commeth from the Jeſuits, expoſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the laſh of ſo many foule mouthes, as there are men amongſt them: that the Jeſuits will nip a man, as if a man ſhould nip a young bud of a Flower, or Tree, or a Witch, a young childe in the Cradle; that he ſhall never thrive after. The great Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church in <hi>Cambray,</hi> neere <hi>Doway;</hi> uſeth a peculiar way of ſervice, much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Church-demeanour and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152599:138"/> of <hi>Rome:</hi> And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath long endeavoured there to introduce her cuſtomes. And I know, ſaid this Monk to me, that upon admiſſion of ſuch a change, in the next age the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would perſwade the world, that the Church in <hi>Cambray,</hi> did never diſſent in any ſmall point from her. This is a great ſatisfaction to me, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> both is, and hath beene a long while, altogether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the catch; and that ſhe leadeth her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, age after age, ſtill into more blindneſſe. I condemne in this Monke, that he ſpoke moſt irreverently of a perſon in high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority amongſt us; and one of the faireſt flowers in Chriſtendome: when he ſpeakes the words againe, I pray God his tongue may ake. It is very common with our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Romaniſts beyond the Seas, to ſpeake very uncivilly of thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> to whom they owe duty. This Monk related a home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtory: (and I had many from him; for it is their uſe, to cheere up their ſubjects with merry conceits) When I lived in <hi>Spaine</hi> (ſaid he) a certaine man was poſſeſſed with a Devill, and the Prieſt exorciſing him in the Church, the people being preſent, a bold Spaniard ſtepped out, and ſaid, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pray let me ſee the Devill, I would faine ſee the rogue come out of his mouth: But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152599:139"/> the Devill anſwered by the mans mouth, that if he came out of the mans mouth in whom he was, he would go in at the others-: you may gueſſe what part (the Monk ſpoke it plainely.) Whereupon (ſaid the Monke) the Spaniard immediately betakes himſelfe to the holy-water-pot, and ſitting downe ſo deepe in it, that the water hid a great part of him, gives the Devill very foule tearmes, and provokes him twenty times over, to come if he durſt: But coward, he durſt not come. I will not tell all. I will keepe ſome for a deare yeare, and a rainy day. Yet you may gather from theſe premiſſes, I could not but ſee, that hypocriſie and malice in their full growth, dwelt even here, as well as abroad; and that here, the purity was not to be found, the <hi>idea</hi> of which I bore in my minde. Wherefore, it was my owne firſt motion, and I left them, and became a Frier; the Friers profeſſing more ſtrictneſſe. A man may impute theſe changes either to variableneſſe, and inconſtancie, or to the ſtirring of good and able motives, and to Gods providence, that would carry me out of one roome into another, and ſhew me all the inward Chambers of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Take heed, judge not. But if you do, I ſubmit my neck, lay what waight upon me you pleaſe, if you offend not God. For
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152599:139"/> I deſerve both your judgement, and your ſcorne.</p>

                  <p>THe Monks have one ſtory amongſt them, and they make it a Pulpit-ſtory. A very devout Monke walking one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in a wood (and I thinke, they loſe themſelves in this wood, when they relate the ſtory) by chance heard a Nightingale ſing; and while ſhee did variouſly deſcant upon her ſong, he laid hold upon it as a hand from Heaven, by which he was lifted up to Gods eminencie, and to the picture and perfection of the Nightingale in him: and there he ſtayed in contemplation, catcht from his ſenſes, till many yeares were paſt, and all the Monkes of his time, dead in the Monaſtery in which he lived. All which time ſeemed to him very ſhort, and to bee merrily paſſed in hearing the Nightingale. Yet (ſay the Monkes) this Muſitian could not be a Nightingale, though his heavenly meditation was indeed begun, and ſung to, ſome while by a Nightingale. But the Monk admiring an excellencie in the creature, and being quickly filled with it in the brooke, went forward towards the ſpring, and roſe

It is a high matter: Yet I ſhould deſire in this, and other things, to give more ſatisfaction then a ſtory comes to, of a man in a wood, that could not finde his way out againe. In lieu of their ſweete ſtory, take a word from me, without encroaching upon a ſecret, which God hath reſerved to himſelfe.</p>

                  <p>THere was a Time, (if I may ſay ſo) when there was no Time: no world: none of all theſe pretty things, we daily ſee; nor yet, the light, by which we ſee them: no men and women like our ſelves: no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures: no aire, earth, ſea: no Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, no Jew, no Chriſtian, no Hell, no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no Divels, no Angels; no God I cannot ſay: For God alone had being before the world; as God onely now alſo hath firme and true being. For, all other things that be, be not of themſelves, but gaine their being onely by participation from God. <hi>Et aſpexi,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin, caetera infra te,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; vidi nec omnino eſſe, nec omnino non eſſe: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe quidem, quia abs te ſunt, non eſſe autem, quia id quod es, non-ſunt; id enim vere eſt, quod incommuntabiliter manet.</hi> And I beheld the things that are under thee, and I ſaw them, neither to have a true being, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to want a being: I ſaw they had a being, becauſe they are from thee; and I ſaw they had no being, becauſe they are not that which thou art. For that truely is, which hath a being without change. If one of us ſhould wiſh now, prompted by curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, to have beene before the world; it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152599:141"/> would be an idle wiſh, and with as little ground, and foundation of likelyhood to have beene effected, as the world then had in effect. For no place, no little corner had beene, wherein to have beene: no aire to have received, and reſtored again in, breath: nothing to have appeared, or play'd with the ſmalleſt glimmering before the eyes. What God did before he built the world, although Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith wittily, he was buſie in making Hell for vaine and curious Inquiſitours; (hee meaneth ſuch, as will not bee quieted with any reaſonable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) yet he well knowes, who knowes, in what the divine happineſſe reſteth, and how abſolute God is of himſelfe, and free from all neceſſary connexion with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. All that which God now does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the actuall government of the world, and the acts conſequent to it; he did before: we know and beleeve that he does now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template himſelfe. For in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe. For in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe, conſiſteth his bleſſedneſſe. Therefore we may ſafely know, and ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve; that he ſtood ſtill in all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in himſelfe, taking a full view of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his owne perfections, which are himſelfe. He now ſees in themſelves to be, what before he ſaw in himſelfe would bee. Nor was he ever idle before the world,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152599:141"/> otherwiſe then the Bleſſed ſhall be ever after the world. And if the Beatificall viſion, that is, the ſight of God, from which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Bleſſedneſſe, doth ſo fully, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſatisfie the Bleſſed in Heaven; that they cannot turne aſide the buſied eyes of their underſtanding, the tranſitory ſpace of one minute, from that they ſee, even though they ſhould be enticed, and tempted to look aſide, with all poſſible delights: (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt ardently love, for the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able excellencies diſcovered in it) was not God ever well buſied, who ever had, and hath an infinitely more ſearching, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſight of himſelfe, then all the Bleſſed either ſhall, or can ever have together? The divine perfections, as they have many other, ſo they have alſo this prerogative; that alwayes ſeene, they both are, and ſeeme ſtill moſt faire, and as they loſe nought of their ſubſtance, ſo they never bate any thing of their beauty: Now whereas, not onely the perfections of all creatures that are; but alſo, of all that are poſſible, are in God; and that in a moſt eminent and boundleſſe manner: how can it ſtand that God did not finde matter in himſelfe for perpetuall exerciſe? eſpecially, ſince that nothing is come new to him by creatures, but their actuall dependance upon him, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152599:142"/> ſtile of Creatour, and the Government: all that which is added, being ſtill out of him, or derived from that which is not in him; and conſequently, no part of his Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: nor any thing which can throw the infamy of change upon him. We may judge what is poſſible to be done, by what is done. And if things are poſſible to be done, a power muſt be which can doe them. And they cannot come from him, when he does them, but becauſe they were firſt in him. For, <hi>nihil dat quod non habet, vel formaliter, vel eminenter:</hi> no Giver giveth but what hee hath, either ſo as it is given, or in a better ſtraine. And they cannot be in God, but as they are himſelfe, and infinite. God doth not depend of the world, but the world of God. If the world had never yet beene, he had ſtill remained the ſame God, moſt great, moſt glorious: A King, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubjects; becauſe all things, bee they future, or onely poſſible, are as actuall, and preſent to him: Omnipotent; able to make the creatures we now ſee, and farre more excellent, to which we are not warranted to ſay, he will ever bend his power. For therefore God leaveth many things undone, which reaſon teacheth us may be done: to preach this doctrine, that creatures are not his upholders. Contemplation in us, is a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152599:142"/> moſt noble exerciſe, becauſe performed by the moſt honourable faculty of the ſoule, the underſtanding: and by the higheſt and moſt elevated acts of the minde. What then may we thinke of contemplation in God? <hi>Syneſius</hi> having turned his ſpeech to God, hath a ſweet expreſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>ANother application of the former ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is to give us in a perfect forme the ſhape of their conſideration, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. But why muſt they needs conſider and contemplate in a Monaſtery? And if they will contemplate there, why is every man diſintereſſed from a lawfull calling, by which he may concurre to the benefit of the Common-wealth? <hi>Homo naſcitur Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae,</hi> ſayes the Civill-Law, A man is borne for the Common-wealth. And the reaſon which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives, why a man may not kill himſelfe, is, becauſe hee may not lop himſelf from the Common-wealth, of which he is a branch.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152599:143"/> they ought to have done, not underſtanding how much they exalt them by prayer. But without queſtion, the Monkes of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> time, were no ſuch idle bodies as now they are. For then every man had his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall courſe of life, to which his education had inſtructed him; and they which had none, laboured in Gardens, and other plats of ground, digging and ſowing; and eating their bread in the ſweat of their brows. Nor is it a reaſonable diſcourſe, that becauſe ſome few of the old Chriſtians, flying from the bloody hands of their perſecutors, hid themſelves in Woods, Wilderneſſes, and ſecret Caves, and corners; wee ſhall ſtep over the like cauſe, and take hold of the like action. Shall we make to our ſelves an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the reſt of Heaven, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the toyle, which goes before it; of which toyle, the reſt of Heaven is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? And they loſe a faire number of waighty occaſions which the world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, and which God miniſters, as the food of vertue, and the gates of victory: and they are faine to referre all to the firſt Act of entring into the Monaſtery; or they would be much to ſeeke. When I was a <hi>Romane,</hi> the Pope was ſolicited by the Embaſſadours of <hi>Spaine</hi> to give leave, that the great increaſe of Monkes and Friers in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152599:144"/> their Countrey might be reſtrained; and the reaſon was given, becauſe it was feared, that the warres, and the Monaſteries, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeverall wayes, would unpeople the Common-wealth, and deprive the King of ſubjects, neceſſary to his Dominion. If ſuch a grievance may riſe from the exceſſe, why may not a reaſonable complaint be made of every knowing and able member of a Common-wealth, that buries his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in a Monaſtery, and ſeekes onely him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? In a Chriſtian Common-wealth, the good of the Church ought not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; when by ſuch an action of prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Common-wealth is endamaged; becauſe by the Common-wealth the Church ſtands; and the Church is but a good part of the Common-wealth, And after all, why cannot they conſider their owne eſtates, and the condition of the world in which they are; and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of high things; and admire Gods creatures; either in their chambers, if they were in the world, or in the fields, as <hi>Iſaac;</hi> of whom we reade, <hi>And</hi> Iſaac <hi>went out to</hi>

                     <p>One, a man like us, labours, and ſtraines himſelfe to know throughly the nature of the Angels; their office; their properties: and how one Angel differeth from another in the perfection of nature, and glory. This learned man preſumeth to inſtruct the world in ſtrange things: and to ſay, that there are nine Orders, or Quires of Angels: and that ſome out of every Quire fell from God: and moreover, is bold to tell us, that <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel in Heaven, ſitteth above <hi>Gabriel;</hi> and <hi>Raphael</hi> the Seraphin, above them both: and that ſo many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels may well ſtand together without much thruſtingupon a needles point, while the ſilly creature ſoaring above himſelfe, forgets himſelfe, and the maine point; and knowes not what he is that talkes thus. Another dwelling upon earth, hath his dealing in Heaven amongſt the Stars; and teacheth for a truth, that if we are born under ſuch or ſuch a conſtellation, ſuch and ſuch ſtrange things will certainely befall us: we ſhall die ſuddenly by fire, or by water; or by a fall of a houſe, or from a houſe; or be the prey of a Lion. And this profound man is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that if a Starre ſhould looſe hold, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152599:145"/> tumble downeward, it would more then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the world; and then, (ſayes he) where ſhould we be? And the plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning people are amazed, when they heare him ſay that the Sunne runnes ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of miles in an houre. But this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man ſtandeth above himſelfe, and above the ſight of the creatures at hand, which firſt offer themſelves to his thoughts, and knowes not what is here below. Others caſt themſelves beneath themſelves, and their ſoules; and are wondrouſly taken up in the curious inquiſition of inferiour matters. The wiſe Phyſitian is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale the great myſteries of nature, and the naturall uſes of almoſt all naturall things: but urge him upon a tryall, and he cannot preſcribe Phyſicke to his owne ſick conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Where is a Tradeſman that doth not underſtand the ſecrets of his own Trade far better then the ſecret ſtate of his own ſoule? Theſe wretched people have tooke a fall; and are under themſelves: they faile in the firſt ground, and foundation of all true learning. A man may wiſely aske the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Why in the blinde ages before Chriſt, the Devill ſpeaking from the mouths of Images, gave to men many good and ſolid documents? The maine hinge upon which the queſtion turneth, is: The Devill not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152599:145"/> onely doth evill, but alſo doth altogether intend evill: what then hath hee to doe with good? I will take the true anſwer: The Devill well knew that the world was even then abundantly ſtored with grave, and wiſe people; who were alſo morally ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: and that if he did not anſwer in ſome ſort, to their pious and reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he would ſoone loſe the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a God. And therefore, amongſt divers other ſound inſtructions, delivered by the Devill in oracles, this alſo was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, know thy ſelfe. In which the Devill more willingly diſpenſed with a ſhew of ſanctity; as knowing, that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition would in the end prove uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall: becauſe no man can truely know himſelfe without the preſent aſſiſtance of Grace: of which the poore Heatheniſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were altogether deſtitute. Our bleſſed Lord, whoſe end was to diſſolve the machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Devill, doth as ſtrangely, as excellently, exhort us to the deepe, and powerfull knowledge of our ſelves; not in word, but in worke; in the working of a miracle. It is written, that he reſtored a man to ſight, blinde from his birth. How did he reſtore him? by his will onely? No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by his word onely? nor ſo. The manner of the cure is uncovered in theſe words:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152599:146"/> 
                        <hi>He ſpat on the ground, and made clay of the</hi>

                        <hi>ſpittle, and he annointed the eyes of the blinde man with the clay.</hi> But let me ſee, is it clay? touch not my eyes with clay: it will rather put them out, then cure them. Now I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, our omnipotent Lord, here worketh by contraries: that it may bee knowne, not the thing applyed, but the power of him that applyed it, wrought the cure: while he clearely teacheth us, that the knowledge of our ſelves, and of our meane foundation, being, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>earthly;</hi> with a requiſite application to our ſelves; is the onely inſtrument, which openeth the eyes of a man blinde from his birth, as we all are. And why doth our good Saviour ſo preſſingly ſtirre, and invite us to the knowledge of our ſelves? It is but one ſtep to the reaſon. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up,</hi> ſaith S.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul.</hi> All knowledge puffeth us up, and ſwelleth us with pride, but the knowledge of our ſelves. When we ſpread our feathers of pride and oſtentation; if we but glaunce upon the knowledge of our ſelves, our plumes fall, and we begin to be humble.</p>

                     <p>MAn conſidered in his body, is a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned peece of dirt. A ſtrong one? no. For, make his image of ſtone, or wood, or almoſt of any vile thing; and it will bee more ſtrong, more durable then he. I will ſet aſide holy Scripture; and prove my ſelfe to have beene made of earth beyond all contradiction: Every corruptible thing (and I may go to a dead mans grave, and finde that I am a corruptible thing) when it naturally periſheth, turneth into that of which it was made: I periſhing after a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall manner, turne into earth: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will follow, I cannot hold it: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was made of earth. If I conſider man in his birth and life, it is the great bleſſing of God, (to his great praiſe be it ſpoken) that he is not, <hi>ante damnatus, quam natus,</hi> condemn'd before he is borne. He is borne with the great paine of his poore mother that beares him: and he cannot bee made more naked, more poore then he was, when he was borne. If a man ſhould looke upon him here, and know nothing; hee would little thinke that the little thing could ever be the wilde Author of ſo many foule ſtirres and tumults in the world. A child

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152599:147"/> know any thing. And then endeavouring to know, we learn evill eaſily; good with great paine. And in our firſt leſſon which the world giveth us, we learne to ſinne. What is that? to breake the Divine Law, and forefeit our ſoules to eternall damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The end of one miſery, is not onely the end of one, but alſo the beginning of another: and thus we live, toſſed continually betwixt fire and water. We beleeve, and goe on a little: then we doubt, and there we ſtop: we hope, and follow the good we hope for, like a wandring fire by night, and then we feare, and grieve, and deſpaire, and there we ſink. In the reaſonable ſoule of Chriſt, good acts paſſed from one to another without any ſtop, or interpoſition (at leaſt, all the while he waked; I reflect upon him that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152599:148"/> ſaith, <hi>I ſleepe, but my heart waketh. Cant.</hi> 5. 2.) So that one vertuous thought followed another in ſo cloſe and preſſing a manner, that they were not onely broken or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the foule exerciſe of evill, but they were never at leaſure, never ſate idle in the Market-place, never out of the faire, and ſolid practiſe of good. For example: when the deepe exerciſe of Humility had kept the thoughts in worke and wages awhile, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe gave up the keyes, and government to patience. Then patience farthered in good by evill men, put the Scepter into the hands of Charity. Then charity changed into ſorrow for the ſinnes of the world. And ſorrow might beget ſtrong reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fortitude to die for them. And thus the ſoule of Chriſt tooke her ſteps from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to vertue. But in us now love raigneth, and ſoone after, hate kils it with a frowne. And then perhaps, indifferent thoughts may ſtep forward in the by, and the ſoule may wonder a little without the knowne fellowſhip of good or evill. And then the fight of money may breake up all, and ſell the heart to covetouſnes. And then refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may coole it with a drop of ſorrow. And then vexation may ſet all on fire with anger. And then the love of drinke may come waſhing the way, &amp; quench anger. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152599:149"/> then the heart may reject what it loved, and preſently deſire the thing, which even<note place="margin">Salu. <hi>lib. I. de gubern. Dei.</hi>
                        </note> now it rejected. <hi>Humanae mentis vitum, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis ea ſemper velle quae deſunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salvianus,</hi> It is the fault of the minde, alwayes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the things which are wanting. And at laſt, according to the Poet, <hi>Frigida pugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant ealidis, &amp;c.</hi> Hot, cold, moyſt, dry, fighting together, and ſtriving to make a new quality, of hot, cold, moyſt, dry; may breed confuſion, and neither gaine the day. We make good purpoſes, and begin a new life; we turne up the eye, and all in haſte, we will be very good and godly men and women; we will be humble, patient, ſober: but our vertuous courage quickly droops; and in a ſhort time, we are the very men and women that we were before: And yet not the ſame, but a degree worſe; for grace neglected, drawes a curſe upon us. We are pretty cleare, and merry, and then comes a cloud, the loſſe of goods, or good-name, or friends, or of a thing like theſe, which cooles and darkens all: and our ſweeteſt joyes are ſooner or later ſteeped in ſorrow: we are now ſomewhat pleaſant; then dull; then outragious; and for the time, loſe our wits, and are mad. Doe all that wee can, and all that God can enable us to doe; we pleaſe one, diſpleaſe another: this man
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152599:149"/> ſmiles upon us, the other frownes; and yet both have the ſame motive. But the beſt is, it is the voyce of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the other Apoſtles, <hi>We ought to obey God, rather then men. Certe,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome, quot</hi>

And in the laſt place, an old houſe fals, or an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row goes out of the way, or our feete ſlip, or the Devill comes to us in the outſide of a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152599:151"/> Saint, (it is his courſe with drooping, and melancholy ſpirits) and tels us religiouſly, that we ſhall give glory to God, or at leaſt, eaſe and comfort to our ſelves, if we cut our owne throats, or hang our ſelves; and we are dead, gone. Perhaps we may leave our pictures behinde us with our friends; but what are they? a meerely, a meere deceit of the Painter: our pictures are no part of us; neither doe they repreſent us as we are: we are dead, we ſee but one anothers faces when we are alive; we are parted in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; we cannot mingle into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as wine and water; and therefore death puls one out of the others boſome.

And any man, being wicked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, may ſend (with Gods leave) a wicked man to Hell, in the turning of a hand: and then, what would he not give to bee with his friends in the world againe? Here the reaſon fals open, why never yet from the beginning of the world, any wiſe man died, but if he could ſpeake, in his laſt words, he cryed out againſt the vanities of life, and of the world.

                     <p>IF I conſider man in his death, and after it: He dyes, that never dyed before: Hee dyes, that knowes not what it is to dye. Which of us knowes, what the pangs of death are, and how going naked, agrees with the ſoule? It is as true, as old; Death is of all terribles the moſt terrible. For, howſoever the holy Spirit in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is pleaſed to call it a ſleep; it is not a ſleep to the wicked. It is recorded of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Our friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleepeth:</hi> and of Saint<note place="margin">Io. 11. 11. Act. 7. 60.</note> 
                        <hi>Stephen, And when he had ſaid this, he fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep:</hi> And of the Patriarchs, and Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> that they ſlept with their Fathers. But this was the death of the Saints, <hi>ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> And the ſoule of man now leaving the body, carrieth no mortall friends with her; they ſtay behind: the brother, and the ſiſter, and the wife, and the pretty little children, with the ſweete babe in the cradle. No temporall goods, or evils rather: nothing but good or evill<note place="margin">Revel. 14. 13.</note> workes; <hi>and their workes doe follow them.</hi> All the faireſt goods, which made all people in all ages, proud; are ſtil extant in the world: and will be after us, even to the end of the world. And although the living
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152599:152"/> talke pleaſantly of their dead friends, and hope well: while one looketh ſoberly, and ſaith; I doubt not but ſuch a man, or ſuch a woman, is with God: another, neither truely doe I: a third, he? ſhe? there is no queſtion of it: if he, or ſhe be not in heaven, what ſhall become of me? Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this plauſible and ſmooth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not one of theſe three tenderhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and charitable perſons, nor any one living here in the world, knoweth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whither they were carried. This we all know certainly: Many of them are moſt heavily tormented in Hell, and there curſe <hi>the Father of mercies, and the God of all conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> and the world, and all their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſin, and all their friends, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all Gods creatures, in the very ſpan of time, wherein their friends ſpeake well, and judge charitably of them: while they diſtribute their words without the leaſt change of countenance, and little thinke of their moſt wofull, and moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition. And the Devill, though it is open to him after this life; yet cunningly keepeth from us who are ſaved, and who damned. If one of us were now in Hell, (but it is a darke and horrid place, God keepe us from it) hee would quickly thinke: Had I my body and life againe;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152599:153"/> whither would I not goe? What would I not undergoe to ſhun this wofull extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? I would lye weeping upon the cold ſtones, all covered with duſt, and aſhes; if it might be ſuffered a million of yeares, for my ſinnes: I would begge my bread of hard-hearted people in a new world, from one end of it to the other: I would ſpend as many lifes in trembling feare, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trembling, if I had them, as there bee lifes in living creatures: I would doe any thing. Now my ſoule doe not grieve, that Hell is provided for ſinners; for ſuch griefe ſtands ſo farre under the loweſt degree of vertue, that it is a ſinne: but give two teares at leaſt, from the eyes of thy body; becauſe thou haſt ſinned againſt thy good God. Such teares are Pearles, and rich ones, and will in time make thee a rich man: The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers call theſe teares, the jewels of Heaven, and the wine of Angels. And as the world was a gallant world, and there were ſuch creatures, and ſuch doings, as we now ſee, before I was any thing: ſo it will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God pleaſe, in the meane time, to cut off all by his glorious and ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, remaine a very gallant world; and there will againe be ſuch creatures, and ſuch doings, when I ſhall lye quietly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, corrupt and putrifie, and by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152599:153"/> little and little, fall away to a few wretched bones; and theſe ſhall remaine, to mocke at what I have beene. And he that is now ſo trim, and ſo much talk'd of, ſhall not be ſo much as remembred in the world; his generation ſhall forget him; and people will ſpeake, and behave themſelves, as if he had never beene.</p>

                     <p>THe reaſonable ſoule, though now of compoſition, is compoſed of three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the Underſtanding, the Will, the Memory. All faculties being active, have one moſt proper act or exerciſe, to which they are moſt, and moſt eaſily inclinable; if not reſtrained. The moſt proper act, or operation of the Underſtanding, is, to ſee, or know Truth: Of the Will, to will, and love good: Of the Memory, to lay up, and keepe in it ſelfe, as in a Treaſury, all profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table occurrences. By the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Underſtanding is dazled in the ſight, or knowledge of Truth: By the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Will becomes chill, and colde in the willing, and loving of good; ſo colde, that it wants a fire: And from the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Memore hath learn'd an ill tricke of treaſuring up evill, where it ſhall be ſure to be found againe; and of caſting aſide good,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152599:154"/> where it may be loſt with a great deale more eaſe, then it was found. Where one part is wounded, and one well, one part may ſuccour and cheriſh the other; the part well, the wounded part: In the ſoule, all parts are wounded. And therefore there is great neede of Grace, and ſupernaturall helps; that ſtrengthened by them, wee may recover health, and <hi>partes deperditas,</hi> the parts we have loſt. Lord, aſſiſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation with thy Grace. Wherefore the holy Apoſtle, ſpeaking of thoſe, who in all their adventures were guided onely by the weake directions of nature, ſayes, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi>

                        <hi>vaine in their imaginations, and their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh heart was darkned:</hi> Firſt, vaine; and then more darke. Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> Tranſlation ſpeaketh after this manner in <hi>Geneſis: The</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>earth was vaine and voide, and darkneſſe was upon the face of the deepe.</hi> What the Eye is in the body, the Underſtanding is in the ſoule. The Eye is the naturall guide of the body, the Underſtanding is the naturall guide of the ſoule. For, when we beleeve, as well as deſire, the things we doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, even then alſo we take a naturall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Underſtanding; which he holds a convenience of ſuch things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the motives, with beliefe, and deſire; though not with Underſtanding. The Eye
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152599:155"/> ſees the outward ſhape of a thing: the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſees both outwardly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; as being advanced more neerely in its degree, and therefore alſo in its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to God. The Eye diſcernes one thing from another: the Underſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives as much. The Eye judges of colours: the Underſtanding judges of white and blacke, of good and evill. The Eye cannot ſee perfectly many things at once: and ſuch a one is the underſtanding: For, the more a power, be it ſpirituall, or corporall, being finite, is ſpread and divided in its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, the leſſe power it hath in every particular. The eye ſees other things, but I cannot turne it inward to ſee it ſelfe: the Eye of the ſoule lookes forward; but in the body, it ſhall never obtaine a ſight of it ſelfe, in its owne eſſence. Indeed, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is a kinde of Eye: and the Eye is a kinde of Underſtanding. Such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſweetneſſe of agreement there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſoule and the body, which moved to the marriage, and union betwixt them. Now, this Underſtanding, this Eye of the ſoule, is not altogether blinded by the great miſchance of originall ſinne. For, <hi>omnia naturalia ſunt integra,</hi> as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſayes of<note place="margin">Dionyſ. Areop.</note> the fallen Angels: all the naturall parts are ſound. How? from being broken, not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152599:155"/> from being bruiſed. This Eye then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though darke, ſo farre ſees, that it ſees it ſelfe leſſe able to ſee; ſomewhat darke in the ſight of naturall things; and much more then ſomewhat darke in the ſight of ſpirituall things. I may ſtand betwixt both, and clearely behold the different caſe of the ſoule, before and after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> in order to ſpirituall contemplation, and practiſe: if I looke upon the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a man in health and ſickneſſe; in order to the actions, and operations of life. The ſicke man is weake, and ill at eaſe: his principall parts are in paine; his head, his heart: He cannot uſe his minde ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, but his head akes: he cannot looke ſtedfaſtly; nor at all, upon a ſhining object: diſcourſe is tedious to him; if it be of high things, he cannot endure it: he cannot taſte aright; bitter is ſweet, and ſweet bitter, to his infected palate: hee hath litle ſtomach to his meate, hee loathes it: and when hee eates, it will not ſtay with him; or if it does, he cannot digeſt it perfectly: hee cannot ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaning; hee cannot goe without a ſtaffe: he cannot runne without one. And why all this? Becauſe he is ſicke, becauſe he is a very weake man. O <hi>Adam,</hi> what haſt thou done? but in vaine-. Had the beſt of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152599:156"/> us beene <hi>Adam,</hi> he would have eaten, had there beene a Serpent, and a woman: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had there beene a Serpent, and no woman: perhaps, had there been a woman, and no Serpent: perhaps, had there beene neitheir woman nor Serpent: For, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent with his efficacie, he might have beene both woman and Serpent to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But, let him paſſe. It is beleeved, that God hath forgiven <hi>Adam,</hi> and his wife, who firſt brought ſinne into the world: and we may have great hope, he will be a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted father alſo towards us, that never ſaw the bleſſed houres of innocencie. Nothing can harden his tenderneſſe, but our ſinnes. And there are onely two defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in our ſinnes, conceivable to be moſt odious, and urging to revenge: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, the multitude of them.

                     <p>THe light of the Underſtanding, which properly belongs to the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is onely naturall; and that, leſſe cleare then it was.

But man is ordained for God, as for an end, which goes beyond the graſpe, and comprehenſion of nature; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinity, borrowed from the Prophet <hi>Eſay: Eye hath not ſeene,</hi>

                        <hi>nor eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> And the end ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be foreſeene, and foreknowne by them, who are engaged to direct, and turne the face of all their intentions and actions to the end. Therefore, another light is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, a light above the knowledge and reach of nature, of which, the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by nature is altogether deſtitute. Here is a wondrous defect. Who can ſhew mee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152599:157"/> ſuch another? We naturally ſee, there is a God. Farther, we naturally ſee that all things were made for us, and we for God: (howſoever the Stoicks thought one man was borne for another) And yet, by the proper ſtrength of nature, we cannot goe to him, whom we ſee to be; whom we ſee to be our end; and for whom, we ſee, we were made; nor yet, towards him. Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> one of the moſt ſearching ſpirits that ever was, both a ſpirit and a body, ſolves this hard knot of difficulty, in a diſcourſe of another linage: <hi>Conſultiſſime homini praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut rectis paſſibus ambulet, ut cum ſe non</hi>

I am not commanded to travell for it: whereſoever I am, it is there alſo: I may lift up my hands and take it: if I open my heart wide, it will drop into it. And, as it was the nature of Originall ſinne, to weaken the naturall and to darken the ſupernaturall light of the ſoule: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is the nature of actuall ſinne, to wound nature, and to kill grace; grace on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152599:157"/> being directly oppoſite to ſinne. And thence it comes, that ſtill as we ſin, ſtill we are more darkened: and that ſtill, the more we ſinne, ſtill the more we are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in our judgements; and ſtill erre the more, in the ſight and knowledge of truth. For, why doe wicked men, ingulft in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, apprehend moſt horrible ſinnes, as triviall matters? becauſe their Candle is out, the light by which they ſaw, is darkened with ſinne. Why doe weake Chriſtians, change their opinions from good to evill? from evill to more evill? Why doe they grow more ſtrong and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in evill opinions? Whither ſoever I goe, I muſt come hither for an anſwer: Becauſe ſome private or publike ſins have removed their Candle-ſticke out of his place, and they are in darkneſſe. God bleſſe my heart from the darkneſſe of <hi>Egypt.</hi> It is a pretty obſervation, that although the Iſraelites, and the Egyptians were mingled together; yet the plague of darkneſſe, which was a continuall night, whereſoever it found an Egyptian; was neither plague, nor darkneſſe to an Iſraelite: no verily, though hand in hand, with an Egyptian.

For, if ſo, the things which are ſeene, ſhould be as exactly perfect, as the things which are not ſeene, as repreſenting them perfectly. It is a direct paſſage by corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, up to ſpirituall. For God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes himſelfe accordingly, to the nature of every thing, in which he workes. The Angles are Spirits, and therefore, their directions, even before their union with God, were altogether ſpirituall. But wee, being partly corporall, and outwarly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſenſes, are moſt commonly taught by things, which offer, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelvs to ſenſe.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152599:158"/> what is ſeene may beſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. In all Gods creatures, as being the creatures of one God, there is a ſtrange kind of conſent, combination, and harmony. In earthly things, heavenly things are ſtrangely ſet out, and propoſed to us. For, if the way had not ſome ſpringlings of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with the Country, we could not ſo eaſily know it to be the way. Let a man, or an Angel give me the name of a creature in the world, which will not afford us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good leſſons of inſtruction, concerning the Creatour, and his dwelling-place, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are invited.

The Sunne knowes he muſt runne all day long, or the gratefull variety of darkneſſe, and eaſe, will not ſucceed in due time. The earth knowes, it is her part to ſtand ſtill, or ſhe cannot bring forth, and beare as ſhe does. The Sea knowes, hee muſt ſtill bee ſtirring, or he ſhall be corrupted. Which could not bee; that is, they could not know without knowledge, had they not

Marke that, may ſoule: here thou haſt found him: hold him faſt: let him not goe, till hee bleſſe thee: Nor yet then, till he paſſe his royall word, which ſhall never paſſe; that he will bleſſe thee, and bleſſe thee, and bleſſe thee againe; till at laſt, he ranke thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Bleſſed.</p>

                     <p>FOr, what is the reaſon, that Grace hath ſuch marvellous affinity with Glory? becauſe Grace is the way to Glory.

The ſtate of Grace is, <hi>pax inchoata,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of peace: the ſtate of Glory is, <hi>pax perfecta,</hi> perfect peace.

                        </note> and removes the lover from his owne ſtate to a more high, and ſublime condition. O, how ſhall I aſcend hither? to this high point of love towards God, our God, my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152599:159"/> God, all the Gods I have? There is no way but the untwinding of my heart from all idle affection to theſe low baſe things of earth: for then I ſhall riſe. And as Grace is the true likeneſſe of Glory; ſo nature is not altogether unlike to Grace. For, Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perfection of Nature, according to the worne axiome of Divinity, <hi>Gratia per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit naturam,</hi> Grace perfecteth nature: an agreement is required, and ſuppoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt nature and Grace: and therefore, all the chiefe acts of nature in the ſoule, are of themſelves inclinable, and bendable to Grace; and yet, not altogether of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by Grace: as the naturall ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Will to Charity. Here I have the muſicke, or harmony betwixt Nature, Grace, Glory. As for the correſpondence betwixt Grace and Glory, becauſe they are both in a great part hidden, this needs a very carefull ſearch to finde it. But the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponcence betwixt Nature and Glory, or Earth and Heaven, is ſuch; that becauſe one extreame is apparent; becauſe Earth is apparent, and alwayes before our eyes, one may be found by the other; Heaven by Earth. Becauſe the creatures of God in the Earth, are plaine, even to the dulleſt of us: if they learn the art of uſing creatures, as we doe ſtaires; and goe up ſtep after ſtep, from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152599:160"/> the lower to the higher, from the leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature to the more perfect, (and if we goe ſtill upwards, we cannot miſſe our way) we ſhall come at laſt to the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is the Creatour, bleſſed for ever. Stones, Trees, Beaſts, Men, Angels, God, the cauſe of theſe. Againe, if we deale with any particular Creature, as wee doe with a river; keepe by the ſtreame, till wee come to the fountaine: we ſhall be ſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, as ſure as ſure can be, to finde God in the end of our journey. If I aske the flower, whence it hath its beauty, (for, I know it is a borrowed beauty, becauſe it withers) it will perhaps at firſt be aſhamed to confeſſe, how meanely it was borne: but it muſt anſwer at laſt, from the earth. If I turne to the earth, and queſtion her, whence cam'ſt thou? She will anſwer quickly, and gladly; From God. Nor could the earth, ſo foule a thing, yeeld ſuch a beauty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſtrange concurſe, and helpe of one, moſt beautifull: which is God. Here I have diſcovered certaine ſparkes of the beauty of God, in a flower. I will obſerve now, and admire how frequently holy Scripture thruſts us upon this admirable kinde of learning. <hi>I am the Flower of the field: I am a Vine: I am the way: I am the light of the world.</hi> If I walke abroad in the fields, I have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152599:160"/> faire and moving occaſion, to lift up my heart to him, who is the flower of the field. And when I ſee a faire flower growing in my way, I ſhall doe well to leave it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, with a deſire, thar others comming after me, may from the ſight of it, looke up to the beauty of God. And another ſhall not doe ill, that ſhall come, and crop the flower, and ſmell how ſweete God is. As I turne home to my houſe, I am deſired to turne my heart to him, who is the Vine. If I ſtirre any way, I am ſtirred to thinke of him, who is the way. If I ſtirre no way, and but onely open my eyes; I am exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to climbe up to him, who is the light of the world. If I will ſhut my eyes, and paſſe through Gods world, like a blinde man; it is impoſſible I ſhould behold, either the flower of the feld, or the Vine, or the way, or the light of the world. The Devill (his enemy who is the way, and his enemy, who is in the way) hath wayes to keepe us alwayes buſie; to poſſeſſe our hearts, now with joy, now with ſorrow; now with hope, now with feare; now with love, now with hatred; now with one affection, and now with another: that, if we conſent to it, we ſhall go ſliding through the world; and at laſt fall out of it, as ignorant of good things, as if wee had never beene

                     <p>IT was a principall point in the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine of the Manichees, a rout of Hereticks, very ſtrong on foote in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time: that there were two prime cauſes of things, a faire cauſe of good things, and a foule cauſe of evill things. The unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py occaſion of this opinion was, becauſe they diſcovered many pernicious, and hurtfull creatures in the great ſtore-houſes of nature: which they imagined could not with honour and conveniencie be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him, that we call the good God of all goodneſſe. And Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath left behinde him a remarkable ſtory of a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee, to whom when it was granted, that the Flye for its troubleſomeneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall importunity, was from the Divell; he did eaſily bring on his argument, as it were, under-hand, and by ſtealth, to other creatures, that had a greater ſubſtance, and a more noble being. (Give not place to the Devill in ſmall things.) But if theſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Manichees had but ſtood a while, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152599:161"/> rightly conſidered, by what crooked entry hurtfull things came into the world, at leaſt with leave to be hurtfull: and how all things in the viſible world, even now, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods heavie curſe upon the earth, offer themſelves to be guided to good ends; and are for the moſt part, uſed by Phyſitians, in the recovering, and conſerving of health: or if they had but examined, and ſcanned the perfections every thing hath, in reſpect it is honoured with a being; they would have thought it no abſurdity, to call God in the ſight of Heaven and Earth, <hi>Creatorem coeli &amp; terrae,</hi> the Creatour of Heaven and Earth, and of all things in them. God hath made one thing leſſe perfect then another; to the end, we may more highly eſteeme his better things: For, as contraries, though enemies, are wont to ſet out one the other; and the Swan ſeemes whiter, when the Crow is in preſence: ſo in adverſity, the leſſer things make good the greater. And if divers creatures had not wanted their due perfections, many long ſtories of great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles had beene cut off, and the ignorant world had not knowne that it was hee who made nature, by whoſe power ſhe was reſtored. And perfect men ſhould not have had ſuch open admoniſhment, to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne talents, and to praiſe God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152599:162"/> for his ſingular benefits to them.

Let it goe; that many things were not faſhioned in the firſt Creation, which, after the quality of the earth was altered by the curſe, were ſeene to appeare in ſtrange and antick ſhapes; being indeed, the children of the curſe, not of the earth: as thornes, and brambles, which come againſt us with their pikes in ſo great a number (and moſt commonly, without helpe of tillage, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Wee are the onely viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that ſwarve from the maine end, which is God. <label type="milestone">

And although God became a Creatour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge his power, and that glory might bee given to him, yet God is not proud. For, therefore we are proud, becauſe we exalt our ſelves above our ſelves, and ſnatch that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to us, which is due to God, and pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him by way of royalty. But God cannot lift himſelfe above himſelfe; Nor take from any that is above him, becauſe he has the firſt place. And in good ſooth, this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152599:165"/> Book of creatures, if it may have a name, may be entitled a large deſcription of the Divine power. Bring me to a Man, or a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under God, that can create a bramble, a ſmall haire of a mans head, or an ignorant worme. Beſides, theſe creatures of God are ſo ſtrange, and admirable in themſelves, and ſuch plaine emblems of Gods wiſedome, that although we, who are bred up by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little to them, and ſee them firſt, when we have not the exerciſe of reaſon to judge of them; are by daily uſe, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our child-hood, brought up to a cuſtome of not conſidering them, and their Author, as wee ought: yet, if God ſhould create a man in the ripeneſſe of perfect age, when reaſon hath gained the Scepter, as he did <hi>Adam;</hi> doubtleſſe he would be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with admiration of every thing hee ſaw: ſo excellent, and ſo perfect is every thing in its kinde. He would firſt admire this light, the firſt faire creature, and the firſt thing that would come in his eyes. Thence he would looke up to the Sunne. Then quickly ſpread his dazling eyes upon the heavens; and cry, O wonderfull! Thence fall againe to earth: where hee would be exceedingly taken with the ſtrange ſight of Trees, Birds, Beaſts, Fiſhes; to which a leafe, feather, haire,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152599:165"/> ſcale is not wanting: of fire, and of its active flames, which wonderfully beget one another: of aire, that we take into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and yet ſee not: of water, that comes in drops, and runs away in flouds: of all things, of every thing. And moſt of all, himſelfe would wonder at himſelfe. His tongue would alwayes be ſtriking the ſame ſtroke; and he would ſtill be ſaying, Who made theſe things? Where is he that made them? I would faine ſpeake with him, and behold how excellent he is in his being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo excellent in his wiſedome. He would marvell, how a plant, or flower ſhould grow; and yet not be ſeene to grow, but to have growne: a beaſt goe pulling up, and letting downe his legges in a ſtrange order: a bird move, and make circles in the aire without falling; a fiſh ſwim over-head in the water without being ſtrangled: how a man ſhould ſpeake, and by a little noiſe from his mouth, exactly know the minde of his companion. And all things which we doe not admire, becauſe we have ſeene them being children, before we could aske what God was; this new-created man would not paſſelightly over, as <hi>Alexanders</hi> foot-man over the ſands, without leaving the print of his foot-ſtep; but would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fix, and dwell upon, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152599:166"/> ſtirre from them, except in a journey to the Creatour, and backe againe. For infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, in their degrees they are all perfect, and good, all worthy of admiration; and had God beene ignorant, and not knowne them before he made them, he alſo had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired them: but he admireth not himſelfe, becauſe nothing is ſtrange to him. And moreover, God made all creatures to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate his perfection: all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are diſtributed amongſt creatures, being united in God; as the beames of the Sunne, though ſpread upon all the world, through Sea and Land; yet, meet all in the Sunne, and never was a beame of the Sunne divided from the Sunne, or held from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to goe on its journey with the Sun. And therefore, as we for the weakneſſe of our eyes, can better take a ſight of the Suns faireneſſe and perfection by looking upon it at ſecond hand on the earth; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the comfortable effects it worketh both in aire, water and Earth: ſo likewiſe, for the debility of our underſtanding, wee can better ſtudy Divinity in the great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of creatures, then in God himſelfe, and in his owne originall brightneſſe, with which our underſtanding may not conſort as it is. For in himſelfe hee is beſt knowne to us, by not being able to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152599:166"/> be knowne of us: of whom we can ſcarce ſay any thing, but by way of negation; as denying thoſe imperfections to be in him, which we finde in creatures; at leaſt, in an imperfect manner, and as they are in them. <hi>O our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> I have found thee, even in the creatures here on earth.</p>

Towards the Creatour, as thus: I behold a worme crawling upon the ground: what ſayes he? I may ſay, nothing. He ſayes, as much as I can ſay. He ſayes: I am a little long thing without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or beauty of parts: I creep all the day long: I eate dirt, and that is all my cheere: I beare no Image of God, but only a ſmall print of his foot-ſtep; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I know, I was not made for him, but for men, that follow him in his foot-ſteps: and they looke another way,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152599:167"/> and tread upon me, and there I dye, and ceaſe to be Gods living creature. O man, uſe me as thou pleaſeſt; I am thine: but, let me, I pray thee, be an occaſion to thee, of doing God ſome little ſervice. Bleſſe him at leaſt, for my creation, and for thy owne more perfect; and thanke him heartily, that he would give the little worme, to creep. Had I a tongue as thou haſt, let me tell thee, I would bleſſe him both for thee, and me. Had I been made looking upwards, how happy ſhould I have beene, both here, and hereafter? To God, as thus: when I looke upon the Sunne, I will comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, after this manner: The Sunne is one; God is one: The Sunne enlightens all the World; God fils all the Word: and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light, is either of Nature, Faith, or Grace; and this is a threefold excellencie, comming onely from the bleſſed Trinity: The Sunne warmes powerfully; God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts efficaciouſly: The Sunne melts the Snow, hardens the earth; the one is pure, the other uncleane; God workes diverſly upon the juſt, and unjuſt; melting the one, and in a good ſenſe, hardning the other: The Sunne ſhines equally, upon all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but ſome creatures being more clear, receive his beams more perfectly; God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts no creature from his protection; and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152599:168"/> ordinary providence; but ſome being apt, and diſpoſed to receive more beauties, and helps from him: The Sunne is not defaced by ſpreading his beames upon the mire; God is not debaſed by ſtooping to his work in theſe inferiour things: The Sun is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from ſhining upon us, by miſts, and clouds, which riſe from the earth; The clouds of our ſinnes, riſing from our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corruptions, keepe off the beames of Gods grace from us: The Sunne ſets, but riſes againe; God hides himſelfe a while, but he will not be long abſent; <hi>Heavineſſe</hi>

                        <hi>may endure for a night, but joy commeth in the morning.</hi> And would I require a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act viſible Image of God? He that cannot reade, can reade in Gods great booke of creatures, if he has eyes; where the hand is faire, and every letter a great one. Away with theſe brazen, ſtony, and woodden Images of God. Be they ſilver ones, away with them. The Sunne is an Image of God, of Gods owne making: and a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Image of God, then the wit, or Art of man can frame; ſet in a high place over all the World; and to be ſeene by all, almoſt every day: imitating God alſo in the ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and diſtribution of his goodneſſe: and yet no kinde of law will give us leave to worſhip and adore the Sunne. O but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152599:168"/> God never appeared in that likeneſſe. Shall I worſhip a Dove, or the Image of a Dove; becauſe the holy Ghoſt appeared in the likeneſſe of a Dove? It exceedingly behoves me to looke about me, above me, under me, before me, behinde me, on each ſide of me, within me. O that I could beate it into my heart! Every where I ſhall finde the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes of God; wonderfull, becauſe not knowne; not knowne, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in that they ſignifie. It is proper to God, to ordaine, not onely, that words may ſignifie things; but alſo, that one thing may ſignifie another: a thing in the World, a thing in Heaven, or elſewhere; a thing preſent, a thing to come. The beſt of us hath but one life to live, and that being once ended, he ſhall never ſee Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this order, and after this faſhion againe. Is this a World wherein to be idle; and to complaine ſo often, we know not how to ſpend our time? I am amaz'd at my ſelfe, at all people. If God ſhould ſay to me, Goe to the end of the World, till you can finde no more land or ſea, that you may be ſav'd; and goe bare foote, and goe upon thornes; would I not goe? And yet I now ſtand idle, when his creatures come home to me, and are with me; whereſoever I am. Lord, teach my hands, and my heart to work.</p>

The Angels have leſſe occaſion of diſcourſe then we: becauſe their naturall knowledge is in it ſelfe ſo marvellouſly plaine: and moreover, is illuſtrated with ſuch variety of ſupernaturall lights; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome are conſtant to them, ſome come when they are ſent: that it repreſenteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to them in a faire character, and in the lumpe; which we are forced to bring together, and home to our knowledge, by diſcourſe. The beaſts have no ground, fuell, or inſtrument of diſcourſe. For, their knowledge is darke; and beſides that it is alone, can paſſe no way but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doores of the ſenſes. And thus, for

                  <p>I Spake but a little before, of going to Heaven bare-foote: and it is my owne caſe. For now I am cut, and carv'd into a Frier. I am going a long journey, in long coates, without a ſhirt to my back. I beleeve
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152599:170"/> this was not Chriſts meaning, when hee exhorted his Diſciples, to be like the little childe, which he ſet in the midſt of them. In this they are not unlike the Croſſe-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in <hi>Spaine,</hi> who in their Proceſſions, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry every man a Croſſe upon his ſhoulders, and having tooke up their Croſſe, follow Chriſt. The Devill had wrought a parcell of the old Monkes into this fallacie, whom <hi>Caſſianus</hi> much blames. (<hi>Origen</hi> had a fault<note place="margin">Joan Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. <hi>Collat. 8. cap.</hi>
                     </note> too.) In my heart, I am of opinion, that a great and maſſie part of them, in their Proceſuons, wherein they whip themſelves, are meere counterfeits. For, it is their uſe in <hi>Spaine,</hi> before they goe to it, to deſire their friends to rubbe and chaſe their backs throughly, with a woollen cloth: and the bloud being ſtirred, will afterwards come from them in their laſhing of themſelves, with little paine. Some will pauſe certain places, and there whip themſelves with more ſeverity. But what places are theſe, thinke you? Under their miſtreſſes win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes; and they beare markes on their outward garments by which, upon agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are knowne of them. And I ſaw one of the greateſt Peers of the Realme, who going in a Proceſſion with theſe Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, becauſe their faces are covered; went along whipping himſelfe in ſtate, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152599:171"/> up one arme in a circle to his ſide, as Gallants uſe to doe; that hee might bee knowne from all the reſt. But I forget. I am in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and my buſineſſe lies at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> I leave much plenty of matter behinde me in all places, that I cannot write, but I am pull'd every way. Here I continued but a ſhort while. For, beſides that I perceived the Friers, for the moſt part, to be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew'd, and ſilly people: their actions were as vaine, as they ſilly. Every night, being met by the fire ſide, one of them plaid upon a kinde of a ſmall fidle, and the reſt danced in their long coates, and their woodden ſhooes, with their legs and feete naked: which did not ſo well become thoſe, that in the ſtreets would not be ſeene to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry, or ſmile. And yet the Friers in <hi>England</hi> are as great Gallants, as the beſt of them. And in their ſerious actions, they are as vaine. For, to exerciſe my patience, they commanded me to ride in the ſight of them all, as coated children doe upon a ſtaffe: And another Frier as big as my ſelfe, was commanded to runne by my ſide, armed with a wand, and whip his Worſhips horſe for better ſpeed. Is this the majeſty of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and chriſtian practiſe? Another time they forced me in a generall meeting, to ſing them a ſong; it was a vaine one, though
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152599:171"/> not a vile one: and afterwards, to ſpend ſome time in catching Spiders. But the top of all was: They ſet me one day upon a high ſeate, like a Throne; and made me a little Pope for the time: And the Friers came kneeling, and creeping before me; and after many ceremonious expreſſions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, kiſſed my bare feete. They are as ſilthily naſty, as fooliſhly vaine. For, every Friday in the afternoone, the Bell rings, and cals them together into a chamber, where a great fire is made. Here they put off their inward coates; and two of them ſtanding by the chimney, at each corner one, hold the coate at length, and with white wands, beate off the Lyce into the fire; which then fall like a ſhower. And they delight ſo much in this abomination of nature; that if a man give a Frier no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Louſe upon his garment; he will thence take the poore benummed creature within doores, into his boſome; and this he does, becauſe Saint <hi>Francis</hi> did ſo. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt never gave way to this utter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of a man, from a man, and from the decent inclinations of nature, Gods good gift, to a ſordid beaſt. And theſe buſie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine are doubtleſſe a great hinderance to the quietneſſe of their prayers, and other devotions; and make them ſhrug, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152599:172"/> to the Lyce, when both their thoughts and bodies ſhould wait upon God. But the Lyce were not the onely biters in the Friery. And here my Reader ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what religious hearts, theſe religious perſons, that compoſe the monſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> beare one towards another. For, the Monke, by whom I was directed in the Monaſtery, is now in the Friery another man; and confeſſed to be all knit together of craft, and a great ſtudent in the art of policy, and over-reaching. And the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its had their load too; as may appeare by this ſtory, which a ſuperiour amongſt the Friers, told me. A certaine Frier of their coate, and company, comming to ſpeake with a Juſuite at his chamber in <hi>London,</hi> found him earneſt in his ſtudy, behinde a curtaine. After the diſcuſſion of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, the Jeſuit ſtepped haſtily downe, to give order concerning the entertainment of his friend. And in the interim, the Frier looked behinde the the curtaine, and found before his chair, a written book. The title of the Chapter, which then lay open, was: By what motives to ſtirre a widow, (or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free perſon) to give her eſtate into the hands of the Church: and how afterwards, to diſpoſe of her. The Frier, by whom I was informed, named to me a principall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152599:172"/> man of his Order, who then had one of theſe bookes lying by him. Whatſoever the Scribes and Phariſes practiſed, I doe not read that they commended the art of <hi>devouring widowes houſes,</hi> to writing; for the information of their poſterity. THe fortune of the booke, as it was related to me, is this: The Jeſuits dare not print it, leſt it ſhould at any time ſlip beſides their hands into the world. And the Jeſuits that are ſober natur'd, and ſeriouſly given, are never ſuffered to heare of this booke: it is onely permitted to practical men, and at ſuch a time after their entrance into the Order, but not before. I had formerly heard of this booke; and that it was full of damnable conveyances. My Reader may ſee with halfe an eye, that I relate things briefely, and plainely; and that I build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the teſtimonies, which they give one of another; being a ſure way. The learning of bookes, plowes not halfe ſo deepe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frier ſtruck both the Jeſuits, and the Monks, in one turning of his tongue, with theſe words: The Jeſuits are the daily plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and actours of buſineſſes, which we can never anſwer: And were not the Monks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to give out, the other day; that a mad man of their Order wrought miracles? Theſe Friers have a ſleight, by which, they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152599:173"/> confirme their young ones. They have printed under a picture of Saint <hi>Francis:</hi> Saint <hi>Francis obtained of God by his prayers, that whoſoever dieth in his Order, and hath the benefit of confeſſion, ſhall inſallibly goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The Monks have made the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe under the picture of Saint <hi>Benet.</hi> But let them unlooſe this knot without cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it. If their confeſſion come from a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent heart, it will bring them alone to Heaven, in the opinion of the Romaniſts: if it come not from ſuch a bruiſed heart, Heaven is denyed to it, by all their Doctors. The Jeſuits are a little more ſolid. They have a picture, wherein are printed at large, the Prophecies of many Jewiſh Rabbines; foretelling, that God would ſend a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and learned company of men into the World, in the decaying and old age of it, (as I imagine) <hi>for the elects ſake.</hi> Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to turne my thoughts a ſeeking againe, becauſe I had not yet found what I looked for. And therefore I pretended the want of health; and loth to continue a begging Frier, upon theſe tearmes, freely begged leave to depart.</p>

                  <p>I Was now even cloyed, and ſurfeited with theſe vanities. And I meditated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a converſion to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But although I ſtaggered, having drunke deepe of the poyſoned Cups of <hi>Babylon:</hi> yet my whole heart was never converted: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever apply my ſelfe with an open profeſſion, to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this happy time. And ſtill my heart gaped for more knowledge of their wayes. Wherefore I was commended to an uncloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd Monk in <hi>Paris,</hi> with whom I lived a while as a ſtranger; and enjoyed the great benefit of a faire Library. This Monk communicated with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but inclined very much to the Greeke Church. Yet his two Monks (for they were all his family) inclined every way as they went, being ſeldome ſober. In <hi>Paris</hi> I found the fault of <hi>Doway:</hi> that many ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers lived by theft; and that men threw themſelves into danger of their lives, who ſtirred abroad in the black of night, as well neare the Colledges, as elſewhere. Theſe are not good orders of Univerſities: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this a promiſing, and hopefull edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Prieſts. In this Towne I lay at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152599:174"/> watch for a better occaſion. You ſhall have more hereafter. Now onely one farewell to the Friers: They have many Rules of a ſtrange out-landiſh nature, and condition. He that will be rul'd by reaſon, may judge of this Rule. A Frier is licenſed by his Rule, to touch and receive money with his Garment, his ſleeve, or the lappet of his coate, but not with his hand. He is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forbid to touch it with any part of his fleſh. I ſee there may be an equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on committed, as well in manners, as in words. And I ſaw this Rule kept by a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who received a French crowne into a paper. In the defiance of this, and all other Rules of the like profeſſion, I give to him, who is pleaſed to take with his bare hand, and heart; Rules directory in a Chriſtian life, and founded, either in themſelves, or in their grounds, upon the received princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods holy word.</p>

                     <p>REmember alwayes that God is alwayes with you, about you, in you, and in every part of you, and of all his creatures: and that when you goe from one place to another; you leave God behinde you, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152599:174"/> yet he goes with you, and yet, you finde him where you come, becauſe he was there before you came. And that, although not alwayes the ſame, yet ſome Angels, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are alwayes by you, watching over you, and carefully obſerving your behaviour; yea, and oftentimes beholding your heart in outward actions. And let your thoughts and tongue bee alwayes running, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating: Shall I commit an act of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt ſo great a King; ſo juſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Judge; ſo good, ſo pure a God; and in his preſence? It is he, whom <hi>Joſeph</hi> meant, when hee ſaid: <hi>How can I doe this great wickedneſſe, and ſinne againſt God?</hi> How ſweet is God, that ſendeth his firſt and moſt perfect creatures, his holy Angels, downe from Heaven; with an injunction of ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and attending to the meane, and homely affaires of men? The Angels are daily converſant with us; and yet, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcharged from the glorious viſion of God, to whom they are united, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, whereſoever they are: ſuch a pretious mixture, and compoſition of good things, ought the life of man to be; it muſt be compounded of holy practiſe, and heavenly contemplation. The Devill ſtandeth ready to daſh out our braines; to deſtroy the body, and to devoure the ſoule;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152599:175"/> to diſturbe the peace of nature, to confound the elements; to mingle Heaven and Earth; to trouble all: wiſhing earneſtly, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreating, that God would turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his milde face, his gentle eyes, and ſay, Goe my Executioner, revenge my cauſe upon the World. And yet God will not. O the delicacie of the Divine ſweetneſſe! Learne the nature of the Devill. In one thing eſpecially, the fall of the Angels, was like the fall of man. For, as man was more weakened by his fall, in his will, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to doe good; then in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and knowledge of good: ſo the Devill is farre more blunted in his will, then blinded in his underſtanding. As for his naturall knowledge, it is rather dazled, then darkned. And by this notable ſigne, you may know, that his will is moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. For, although it is plaine to him, that for every temptation he ſtirreth up in man; the burden of puniſhment ſhall bee laid preſently, heape after heape upon his ſhoulders; and though he knoweth exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how many ſtrong ties he breakes by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, perceives more throughly the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the offence, and ſees with a more cleare eye the greatneſſe of the Divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty offended; yet, ſtill the perverſneſſe, and faction of his will carries him on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152599:175"/> through all, to miſchiefe. And if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill remaineth yet, ſo perfect in the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall part, by knowledge; <hi>ſans</hi> doubt he knowes, and is verſed in all the poſſible wayes how to invade us; which way our inclinations leane, which ſide is moſt weak; and how he may plant his engine, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of moſt profit to his owne cauſe; and what will beſt follow the faſhion of our fancie. The enemy which we ſee before us, in his owne, and knowne ſhape, ſenſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us to feare; and conſequently, to withſtand, or prevent him. But the Devill we feare the leſſe, becauſe we ſee him not; becauſe he has the art to goe inviſible. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> is of opinion, that every man being alwayes accompanied with a good Angel, and a bad one; ſome by reaſon of the foule enormity of their ſinnes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of God, who never forſaketh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is forſaken, and left alone himſelfe; may be forſaken for a while, or totally, by their good Angel. But I dare ſay that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man was forſaken by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, the Devill. If one of us were but a little while haunted with a Ghoſt, how he would feare, and tremble? every one of us is haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted continually with a Devill; and yet, we feare not, becauſe we doe not ſee him. No man goeth, but the Devil goeth with him: no
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152599:176"/> man ſtayeth, but the Devill ſtayeth with him: no man ſleepeth, (here his action changes) but the Devill waketh by him. And as he is alwayes with us, ſo hee is alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo vigilant about us; that although he doth not know the thoughts of the heart in the heart, and cannot reade them in that booke of Characters; yet he doth oftentimes gather what they are by the language of outward ſignes; and alſo by outward ſignes, foreſtall, and know, even future occurrences, depending upon the will of man. He is a Tempter by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. God alſo may be ſaid to tempt us: but how? by ſcattering rubbs in our way to make vertue more bold, and more labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. What made all the Conquerours famous, but becauſe they conquer'd what was not eaſily conquer'd? But the Devill tempteth with a direct intention to ſinne. God tempteth with a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of good, and of our ſalvation: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, with a furious deſire of evill, and of our damnation. God tempteth us not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our ſtrength: the Devill would, if God would ſuffer him. And as the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquerour, the Queene having eſcaped, carried her image in triumph: So, becauſe he cannot trample upon God, who threw him downe from Heaven; he labours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152599:176"/> himſelfe upon his Image. Suſpect therefore all his proceedings. <hi>Facilius illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita</hi>

                     <p>DIſingage your ſelfe from the world, (miſtake me not) from the love of it. Old Authors obſerve, that the Apoſtles were all clad outwardly, not with Friers coates, but with mantles. And the mantle is a looſe garment which hangs to a man, but by a loope. If it prove troubleſome, if it hindereth in your journey; put your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the loope, and the mantle falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The Apoſtles taught, even by their garments: and the mantles ſerved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate their neglect of worldly things; and to give evidence by what tenure they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152599:177"/> held them. <hi>If riches abound, ſet not your heart upon them;</hi> ſayes he, that was both Prince and Prophet. If they creepe upon you, keepe the infection from your heart; if they breake in upon the heart, they are<note place="margin">Luke 14. 33.</note> mortall. <hi>Except a man ſhall renounce all which he poſſeſſeth, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> ſayes the Prince of Prophets. Then, O rich man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſently renounce all which thou poſſeſſeſt, or elſe turne out-law, and forbeare to thinke thy ſelfe the Diſciple of Chriſt. All. A tearme of univerſality ſhuts the doore againſt every particular. This is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy newes: I feare the meſſenger will bee ill<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 30.</note> paid.

The affection of a ragged poore creature, may be more cloſely tyde to an old houſe, and a pewter diſh; then the will of a great perſon to a Palace, and the revenewes of a Prince. And therefore, our Saviour ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plainely, <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, for</hi>

And becauſe they are poore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, they ſhall be rich in Heaven: <hi>for theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> And the Kingdome of Heaven is not promiſed to

Some ancient expoſitors tell us upon this place, that there was in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> a little gate, which, for its extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtraitneſſe, was called the Needle; the paſſage through it, being accordingly named, the Needles eye: and that, when the Camels came loaden to this gate, their packs were taken off. Theſe Authors inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, that a rich man cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, before he hath laid aſide his burden, his pack of riches. He muſt be maſter of them, and ſo manage them, that they are not a burden to him; he muſt poſſeſſe them, as if he poſſeſſed them not. And theſe Authors conſtrue it, <hi>It is caſier for a Camell to goe through the eye of the Needle, &amp;c.</hi> With which expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that other ſaying of Chriſt ſuiteth, <hi>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that finde it.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 14</note> Thus it is profitable, for the rich man to be rich, if his heart ſtand off from his riches; becauſe he hath a faire opportunity, and more occaſion to exerciſe charity, then the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152599:178"/> poore man: as likewiſe, it is gainefull for the poore man, to be a poore man; if hee take it as a ground of content, obedience, and humility: For otherwiſe, God is no niggard of his gifts. Indeed, perfection muſt ſell all, and give it to the poore: all that which a man loveth vainely: and if all to the poore, part to himſelfe; being poore, when all is ſold. The World is a dunghill, covered with Snow; The Sunne ſhines, the Snow melts, and the dunghill appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. It ſhines like a Glow-worme, but it warmes not. Millions of Angels have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from God: their places are void: they are places in the Court, places of great gaine and honour. We are brought upon a ſtage, a Theater of triall: He that acteth the part of an honeſt man, ſhall have a place.

                     <p>BEare a ſtrong hand over your paſſions. They are mutinous ſubjects, and live within the wals. Man is compoſed of foure contrary elements. But they came to this compoſition upon compoſition, upon faire tearms of agreement. But, the paſſions ſtand yet in the full force of paſſions. There are two great contraries, in matters pertaining to morality; good and evill. The one we naturally deſire to obtaine; to avoid the other. Good, conſidered within the compaſſe of its owne nature, kindles love, the prime, and maſter-paſſion. If it be, or ſeem abſent, it ſtirreth a deſire of it ſelfe. If we deſire it, and conceive it poſſible, hope begins to grow big and we follow it. If impoſſible, deſpaire ſtarts up, &amp; if the good was great and good, playes the mad-man. But when wee fully enjoy it, joy ſmileth in us. On the other ſide, if we make a diſcovery of evill, we hate it. If it be abſent, we put wings to our feet, and flie from it. If it ſhew it ſelfe as inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we feare it. But if it arreſt us, being preſent; we are chilled with griefe. And then, anger, loves ſouldier is at hand; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtrike at every turne, and to turne all into a tumult. And anger fights on both
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152599:182"/> ſides; for, we are angry with the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, which occurre in our purſuit of the thing we love. We love before wee hate, becauſe we hate nothing, but as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to a thing we love. But here is the block of danger: when good appeareth in the forme of evill, and evill in the ſhape of good; or when one is apprehended as the other; no man loving evill, but guilded with a pretence of good. For then we love evill, hate good; deſire evill, flie from good; hope for evill, feare good; rejoyce in the purchaſing of evill, grieve in the atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good. Every thing runs a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and diſordinate courſe: and all the little world of man is diſturbed. <gap reason="foreign">

But if one wheele be out of order, the reſt ſtand waiting for little purpoſe: all the paſſions will adhere to the paſſion then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. It is recorded, that <hi>Semiramis</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:152599:182"/> was an humble Petitioner to the great King<note place="margin">Aelian de var. hiſt. l 7.</note> of the Aſſyrians, whoſe concubine ſhe was; that ſhe might take upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her the government of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and command the Kings ſervants, but for the tranſitory ſpace of five dayes. It was granted. She came forth adorned with a Princely robe: and her firſt words were (O wretch!) Go, take the King, kill him. And by one venturous ſtep, ſhe climbed to a ſettled ſtate of Imperiall government. <hi>Semiramis</hi> repreſenteth paſſion. Suffer it to enter into your houſe, and it will keepe poſſeſſion; give it once the upper hand, and it will claim the courſe of gift, as a priviledge. A paſſion is like fire which is pliable to good uſes, while we keepe it in the place, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a neceſſary inſtrument: but if it paſſe without a guide, it will bring us to an ill paſſe; the paſſion will turne to action, and make a great ſpoyle of all things. In all the uproare of paſſion, keepe the minde calme. Yea, when anger beginneth to inflame you, thruſt off the paſſion by maine ſtrength, and compoſe your ſelfe in a ſweete pleaſantnes of minde, and face. And ſay inwardly: Sweet God, how mild art thou, that ſitteſt quietly in Heaven, when thou ſeeſt thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty moſt grievouſly abuſed here on earth? God doth not require of you to become Stoicks, to pull up paſſion by the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152599:183"/> roote, and to remaine unſenſible. For, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions doe give an edge to vertue, and are the ſupporters of it. God deſireth onely, that in anger, Reaſon ſhould direct, and carry us through the croud: And that anger ſhould ſtay in his owne home, in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of the ſoule, and not breake in upon the minde; and that in all the ſtirring, Reaſon ſhould have her principall motion. For if paſſion be firſt, ſhe will blinde Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and then draw her into her faction; change opinion, alter judgement, worke ſtrangely upon the apprehenſion, turne the diſcourſe, and make another man. And as anger, ſo love, deſire, joy, feare, griefe, and the reſt; are all to be wiſely tempered.</p>

And that when you ſee or heare of the miſeries of other people, God preſents them to your eyes or eares, as warnings to you, and as copious Theames of his praiſe. And that when your faults are objected againſt you, even by furious and angry perſons; the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction commeth by way of permiſſion from

Yea, by dumbe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible creatures. And therefore heare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently what they ſay: which you may fitly doe, in this manner. When you ſee a Lion, looke up to the preſerver, <hi>the Lion of the tribe of Judah:</hi> and downe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, <hi>the roaring Lion,</hi> with an earneſt, and urging deſire to follow the one, and to flie from the other.

When you ſee a Beare, caſt your inward eye upon the Beares which devoured the undutifull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe their parents had not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the very firſt, and moſt common office of Beares, and licked their young into forme.

When you heare a Cocke, the bird of day, and uſher of the morning, crowe:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152599:184"/> take Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by the hand, and goe out or in, and weepe bitterly.

When you ſee a ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and painefull Ant; goe ſluggard to the Ant, and learne ſpirituall husbandry.

                        <p>Whither ſhall I flie, but to thee, O Lord, the rich ſtore-houſe of all true comfort? The croſſe which ſeemeth to me ſo bitter, came from thy ſweet will. Can I be angry with thy good providence? Is it not very good reaſon, that thy royall will ſhould be done in earth, as it is in heaven? And though perhaps it was not thy direct, and reſolute will that all my croſſes ſhould in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have ruſhed upon me; yet the ſtroke of the croſſe being given, it is thy direct inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſhould beare it patiently. I doe therefore, with a moſt willing hand, and heart, take Gaule and Vineger, delivered by thy ſweete hands. I doe kiſſe, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace both the Giver, and the gift. And moreover, give up my ſelfe, and all that I have, to the diſpoſition of thy moſt ſacred will: health, wealth, that which I beſt love here; and liberty, and life, and all, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy when thou calleſt. Croſſes are good ſignes. For the more I ſuffer now, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I hope, ſhall be my glory. And therefore to thee be the glory.</p>

                     <p>MAke a weekely Bill of Gods benefits, and thy ſinnes: and alwayes, when the Lords day commeth, (to which, come thou prepared by prayer and humiliation) bleſſe God more plentifully for thoſe, and for all his other benefits, and crave pardon more ſeriouſly for theſe, and for all thy other ſinnes. And this day prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, fold thy ſelfe within thy ſelfe, and looke backe upon God, as hee was before the world; Be preſent with him in the Creation, as Wiſedome was, which ſaith, <hi>I was with him, making all things.</hi> Stand by and obſerve the ſtrangeneſſe of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. Conſider that which thou canſt not conceive; the nothing that was before the world: the thought of darkneſſe will come the nigheſt to it. Liſten and heare God ſay, <hi>Let there be light:</hi> Marke, with what quickneſſe Light followes: Admire it; and crie out, Lord, there was Light, before there was light, <hi>for thou art Light, and in thee there is no darkneſſe at all.</hi> Conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate of the Church from <hi>Abel,</hi> through the Law of Nature, the written Law, and the Law of Grace, to this houre. Mark how ſtrangely the providence of God hath carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the publike affaires of the world, and the

                     <p>At length, come home to thy ſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thy memory, and diſcover the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tracts of Gods working with thee from thy child-hood, his daily diſcourſe to thy heart, and the ſtrange inventions, by which he hath called thee to him, and thy unkindneſſe. On the other ſide, labour to lay open the plots of the Devill, whether beaten, and ordinary, or ſtrange, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; endeavouring to know, and fortifie thy weakeneſſe.

Mark what God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſaith to thee in thy prayers, and thence raiſe good purpoſes. Let thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour in Gods houſe be ſeaſoned with all poſſible reverence; and with a decent compoſition of body and face; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, with a watchfull carriage of thy eyes.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He provinciall of the Engliſh Jeſuits, being my Kinſman, and the onely Papiſt of all my Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; (who died ſoone after) ſent me to the Engliſh Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Rome.</hi> And in my journey, when I came to <hi>Marſelles,</hi> a Port-towne in the remote parts of <hi>France;</hi> I was ſtrongly conceited, that by the prayers of Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalene,</hi> (whoſe ſhrine, and chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques were not farre off) I ſhould gaine the benefit of a good winde, and be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as I was informed, I might have beene) in foure and twenty houres to <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore I prayed earneſtly to her: but ſhee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152599:198"/> did not heare me: and my conceit was very weake, though it was very ſtrong. For ſixe long weekes paſſed before I could recover <hi>Rome.</hi> It is worthy to be knowne, that in <hi>Marſelles,</hi> when I paſſed through it to it <hi>Rome:</hi> there were but foure or five Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its; and thoſe in a houſe, in the beſt roome of which they could ſcarce all together turn themſelves round: but two yeares after, when I returned; their number was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly encreaſed, and they were ſeated in three faire houſes: One, a <hi>caſa profeſſa,</hi> as they call it, for their old men; another a Colledge for their Students; and the third, a houſe for the tutoring of their novices. And it is not unworthy to be knowne that there is not a Papiſt of any worth in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> whoſe worth in the matter of his eſtate, the Ieſuits doe not exactly know, and have not ſet downe in writing: and that the Jeſuits doe every where profeſſe and publiſh themſelves to be in debt; that they may be thought poore; and lie the more openly, open to the Charity of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>When I came within halfe a dayes jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of <hi>Rome,</hi> and beheld part of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Church, I was taken preſently, (and I have often wondred at it) with a ſtrange riſing of Spirit againſt the City and Church
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152599:198"/> of <hi>Rome:</hi> By which, I did as it were, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage what I ſhould afterwards know. The Church of this Colledge is all painted in the inward. And the pictures counterfeit men and women, that were hang'd, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in <hi>England</hi> (as they ſpeake) either in the profeſſion of faith, or the defence of vertue. And the painter played the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit too. For, he hath cunningly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled old ſtories with theſe of late dayes; the more to deceive the beholder; and to paſſe them all under the ſame cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Truely, if my power had beene pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waight with my will; the Schollers ſhould have complained to the Pope of the foule abuſes, which have beſmeared the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Colledge.</p>
                  <p>It was ſignificant, that <hi>F. Fitz-Herbert</hi> wrote a booke againſt Matchiavell: for why? ſaid one of our Schollers at <hi>Rome?</hi> that he might not ſeeme to be what he was a Matchiavellian; becauſe our craft is void, if we are knowne to be crafty.</p>
                  <p>In this Towne the tricke of counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is in great requeſt. For many vile Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifes are permitted to counterfeit themſelves poſſeſſed with Devils, and openly in the Churches, to make ſtrange ſignes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the eyes, mouth, tongue, hands, and with the whole frame, and building of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152599:199"/> the body; to impreſſe a beliefe into the ſoft, and ignorant Congregation, that the Devill is more ſtirred, and they more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, with the ſight of ſuch and ſuch reliques, of theſe and theſe Images, and the like: the learned part of people knowing, and confeſſing they are foule diſſemblers. Here I heard it confeſſed that the Jeſuits were openly convinced in <hi>Rome</hi> by the Dominicans, to have corrupted Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> And that of Saint <hi>Brigit,</hi> and Saint <hi>Catherine;</hi> the one had a revelation from God, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in originall ſinne; and the other that ſhe was. I heard it likewiſe avouched by themſelves; that in the Inquiſition, when they combate with a perſon, whom they cannot crook and bowe to their owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, ſome young Ruffian appeareth to him by night, in the moſt horrid ſhape of a Devill, who telleth him, with a voice like a Devill, that all of his opinion are damned in Hell; and that a very deepe place is there provided for him: which muſt needs work upon a man uſed to darkneſſe, and affliction, and to ſolitary thoughts. But the truth of God is all-ſufficient, and doth not call de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to helpe her. My reader muſt thinke in reaſon, that I could not but ſtep aſide into a corner, and ſay privately: Have I forſook
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152599:199"/> all my noble friends, and good fortunes, to ſpot my ſelfe with deceit, and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? Nothing is more certaine, then that the Inquiſition is a Den of horrour, and deceit. The Engliſh Jeſuits and Monkes have a great account to give for a man, who was a Monke in <hi>Paris,</hi> and one of the moſt able Schollers in the Chriſtian world. This Monke wrote a learned booke againſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: And had formed another booke; (but it never ſaw light) the ſubject of which was, that the Pope is Antichriſt. Him they carried (having by cunning meanes bended the higher powers to them) into the Low-Countries; and laid up faſt in a Caſtle neere Briſſels; and for more terrour, they barred him up in a comfortleſſe chamber, hanging over a Water-mill: and had they but ſtirred a certaine device, made for the purpoſe; the whole frame of the boards had turned under him, he loſt his footing, fell downe, and been ground into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand peeces. But they reſerved him to bee a more publike example. And the like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice they have at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> receiving the miſerable creature that is throwne downe, in every part of his body, with moſt ſharpe pikes. This Monke they conveyed to the Inquiſition at <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> where they ſo terrified him with the blacke
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152599:200"/> thoughes of being burned; that they drove him into madneſſe. And he was then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Bedlam of <hi>Rome;</hi> and there bound in the necke with an iron collar, and ſecured with an iron chaine to the poſt of a bed: where he ſpoke the Fathers, both Greeke, and Latine, to the great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Schollers that were preſent. They are as cruell, as we mercifull. The Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges both of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> are ſeldome without a mad-man. In both places I ſaw examples. And the mad man in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> had beene a fugitive from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And his words to them continually were, <hi>vos me faſcinaſtis,</hi> yee have bewitched me: But he was the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jeere of them all. O that the Schollers in our Univerſities were all as wiſe as they are learned!</p>

                  <p>THere is a holy place in a Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> called the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> where they receive, as they ſay, that part of skin which was cut from Chriſt in his Circumciſion: and one of the Popes a great while agoe, attempting to looke upon it; a mighty ſtorme comming in thunder, and lightning, and a fierce winde indangered
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152599:200"/> the whole Citie, and frighted away his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>It was an old objection, that in <hi>Rome,</hi> when they ſet a freſh Maid to ſaile in the Stewes, they hang a Flagge, (a knowne ſigne) out of a window. One of our Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to blot out this objection, ſaid, the hanging was expoſed in honour of the Sacrament. But I being in <hi>Rome</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome hangings are expoſed to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Sacrament) found the objection to be true, and ſound. And it is not agreeable to the decencie of Religion, that thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Princes, the Cardinals, ſhould behave themſelves with ſuch open curteſie towards noted women, noted onely for their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like profeſſion of wickedneſſe: or cover one nakedneſſe with another; the naked wals of their Palaces, with pictures, moving to luſt, and venery. The deepe Monke at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> recreated ms with a ſweete hiſtoricall relation; and affirmed the matter to have beene done within a few yeares. Their Agent at <hi>Rome,</hi> having recourſe to a Cardinall, as his occaſions wav'd him; the Cardinall frowned upon him, and urged, that the Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> as he heard, were much given to women. The Agent being a ſubtill head, and knowing the inclination of the Cardinall, replyed, that indeed, the Engliſh
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152599:201"/> women were a powerfull temptation; and that young comely Maids brought the Prieſts every night to their chambers. The Cardinall gave an Italian action with his ſhoulders, and anſwered, Friend, if it be ſo, you ſay truth, the temptation is very powerfull: and ſo the quarrell ended; and the Cardinall began to be graciouſly kinde.</p>
                  <p>Two chiefe things I much wonder at in the Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that many of thoſe high perſons are men of meane, low, and inferiour lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that a young ſtripling in a thred-bare coate, his Uncle being choſen Pope, is the next day, a moſt eminent Prince, and little differing from a King.</p>
                  <p>A notable thing paſſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> a ſmall time before my arrivall thither. It was, that the Pope picked a quarrell with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> (whom he had received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rome</hi> with great pompe, comming from us) under a colourable pretext, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Grecian Schiſme. For hee would not ſuffer ſo great a ſcandall to goe unpuniſhed, leſt it ſhould draw others into its owne example: and he could not puniſh it without a colour. And therefore he was lodged in the Caſtle, where he quickly dyed of griefe: and his body was burned <hi>in cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152599:201"/> Fiori,</hi> a place in <hi>Rome</hi> like Smithfield in <hi>London.</hi> I humbly deſire all religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they talke of this pamper'd man, not to think of me. He was not a native of this Countrey; and in many things he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelfe like an Atheiſt, and an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: he was cut out into a Diſſembler, when he was young; for, he had beene a Jeſuit; I never was, but abhorre the name.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Ligorne,</hi> a Towne lying by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Sea, and ſubject to the Duke of <hi>Florence;</hi> I ſaw the man, upon whom, part of a wall fell, and held him to the ground, while he was tooke in the act of villany with a Calfe: and money had redeemed him. And yet notwithſtanding, it was one of the cheriſhing ſtories, with which the notable Monke of <hi>Doway,</hi> did eaſe me of my burden: That an Italian Gentleman having ſent a wicked Varlot to cut off the noſe of his enemy: (and there are perſons both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to be hired for ſuch damnable purpoſes:) And the deed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in done, the wronged perſon recollected his ſpirits, and deſired to know the ſumme, by which he was induced to that foule enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. Which being told, he gave the like ſumme for the performance of the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploite upon the other. And the ſame vile inſtrument, in the very ſame manner, upon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152599:202"/> the ſame conditions, cut off the noſe of him that firſt imploy'd him.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> they bury altogether in Vaults, and in the time of my reſidence there, the Friers had conveyed a Maid under ground, and having abuſed her, killed her in her grave. <hi>Salvianus</hi> is a great enemy to theſe Hypocrites. His words in one place, are:<note place="margin">Salv. l. 5. de Guber Dei.</note> 
                     <hi>Quid agis, ſtulta perſuaſio? Peccata inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixit Deus, non matrimonia.</hi> Fooliſh perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what doeſt thou? the Law of God forbiddeth ſinne, not marriage. But why doe I taxe them for killing? It is ſcarce ſo hainous in <hi>Italy,</hi> to kill a man, as to kill a dog. When a man is killed in the ſtreets of <hi>Rome,</hi> another perhaps will ſtep to him, and looke if he know the face, to quiet his thoughts concerning his own friends: but he goes his way againe preſently, and makes no ſtrange matter of murder, it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The way of the Italians is, (as the Colledge hath taught me) after a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell betwixt two, one deviſeth preſently how he may kill his adverſary, upon this foundation, becauſe he muſt either kill or be kill'd. Yet in the execution of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned perſon in <hi>Spaine,</hi> I cannot (no, I cannot) but obſerve one commendable paſſage; which I could wiſh that their practice would commend to our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152599:202"/> Sure it would bee a matter of high and publike concernement. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender being dead, immediately ſtandeth up by him, hanging or lying as a triumph of juſtice, a Prieſt or Miniſter, who preſently maketh a ſpeech to the people, not unlike a Sermon; wherein he treats of his offence of the Diabolical deluſions, in which he was enſnared by little and little: of his former life, and of the manifeſtation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice in his end, and death. At which time, he doth ſo point to the dead body, and ſo often ſhew it to the eyes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe hearts are already ſtrucke with the horror of his preſewnt ruine; and moreover, he doth ſo charge, and warne the people by his example; and cries ſo many times, <hi>looke here you who are alive;</hi> that indeed he moves exceedingly to good life. If I goe on, I ſhall never have done.</p>

                  <p>OUr ghoſtly Father in the Colledge, was an old Jeſuit; who had ſaid freely amongſt his companions, that hee had laboured in digging under the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houſe, till every thred of his ſhirt was wet. This man was not a fit Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152599:203"/> for young Schollers, looking towards <hi>England.</hi> The words were proved againſt him by the titular Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> from whoſe mouth I received them. Who ſhewed me likewiſe a ſilver meddall, in which Father <hi>Garnet</hi> was decked with the ornaments of a Saint, and joyned with S. <hi>Ignatius Loyola.</hi> I am bound alſo to his Lordſhip for the ſight of two pictures of <hi>Garnets ſtrawe,</hi> each repreſenting it in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall forme, and one being the ſecond edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the former had beene formerly reprehended, even by me, ſaid the Biſhop. I hope the Jeſuits will not deny that I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved warily, and piouſly amongſt them; and glewed my ſelfe faſt to my meditations when others neglected them, and ſlept their time away; who, when the ſeven Sleepers were read in the Martyrologe at ſupper, would merrily put off their caps in honour of them. But I will onely take my leave of his Holineſſe, and then goe from <hi>Rome.</hi> For I was ſent hence by the Pope to <hi>England,</hi> to convert ſoules; and I brought out of his Treaſure, three thouſand Indulgences with me, which I meane to keepe till they are dearer. The Pope is a Biſhop, and yet a Prince. And the reaſon which Father <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbert</hi> gave me, why the old Ages payed to the Pope ſo little honour, was; becauſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152599:203"/> they ſaw him a Biſhop, and no Prince. If this may ſtand, the chiefe honour is due to him as a Prince; and not as a Biſhop. He is carried in a chaire of ſtate, upon the ſhoulders of men: from which chaire, his bleſſing hath often come and ſate upon my ſhoulders. Kings and Cardinals may kiſſe his hands: others of what degree ſoever, onely the croſſe upon his pantofle. He has the keyes of Heaven and Hell, and alſo of Purgatory; he can turne the key open and ſhut when he pleaſeth. And he doth aſſure the Prieſt, that ſaying Maſſe at a priviledge Altar; that is, an Altar to which this high priviledge is given by his Holineſſe; he ſhall ſree a ſoule out of Purgatory. He will give you very liberally, a plenary Indulgence of all your ſinnes: and remit all the temporall puniſhment, due to the ſlaine in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when the guilt is removed by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He will untie the Lawes of God, and give you leave and freedome to labour in ſervile works: as, to plough, ſow, and reap, on the Lords day; to take for your wife, your neare kinſwoman; to kill the ſubject of any Prince, whom he doth excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. You may goe to the Stewes in the full and open view of authority. I am able to name the man, whom they would have ſuffered to commit fornication, under the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152599:204"/> pleaſing title of a veniall ſinne. Teaching out of his chaire, he cannot erre; they meane, when he doth inſtruct the world in matters of faith. And though he bee an Arrian, a Monothelite, or other Hereticke, the Spirit of God doth not forſake him: for he hath a double portion of his Spirit; and one being loſt by hereſie, keeps the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the. He claimeth to himſelfe a ſupreme Dor minion over Princes, be they Chriſtians or Infidels; and preſumeth to diſengage their true and lawfull ſubjects from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to which they are tied by God. He cannot be depoſed for any crime, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; he will give you, if you pleaſe him, a peece of ſanctified, and bleſſed waxe, which ſhall quiet a troubled Sea, divert the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous aime of witch-craft, ſtay the rude courſe of a devoruing fire, fright away evill thoughts, and make the Devill runne, and doe many ſuch feates. After your death, he will declare you to be a Saint, and in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and give way that Altars and Churches may be conſecrated to your honour, and called by your name; and that the world may pray to you, as freely, and as fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to God; and that your withered bones may be worſhipped; but not till the age be paſt, in which he lived; and the people gone, who were eye witneſſes of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152599:204"/> your life. O the twichcraft of the Devill! If we thinke that we came into the world to throw away our ſoules; wee are too blame. He that ſeeth a great ſtreame of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſſe forward in a calme Sea, may be aſſured that a Whale paſſeth. Here is the ſecret; the ſtreame of all things goeth with the Popes greatneſſe. And yet the Jeſuits keepe him in awe, and in a kinde of ſtrict obedience to them. Indeed they keep other great perſons in ſubjection; and make them Benefactours to them, that their greatneſſe may be long greatneſſe. The Pope dare not compoſe the quarrell betwixt the Jeſuits and the Dominicans; becauſe he cannot, except he ſide with one of them, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the other: And <hi>Martin Luther</hi> cannot bee forgot. And the Monke, I ſo much ſpeake of, threatned his Holineſſe home, in his Epiſtle Dedicatory before the booke, which old <hi>Leander</hi> transformed into good Latin for him. The booke was made in the heat of thoſe deadly quarrels betwixt the ſecular Prieſts and the Regulars; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they accuſed one another of hereſie, and of ſtrange things.</p>

                  <p>TO dry up this foule water in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: The Pope is not head of the Church; becauſe this high, and ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power would then have moſt ſhone out, and appeared in the Chriſtian Hemiſphere immediately after Chriſt had given the commandement, upon which they build this power, this <hi>Babel</hi>-Tower. Nor could the rage of outward perſecution hinder the perfect execution of ſpirituall power.

They ſay: It is neceſſary to have an infallible Judge for the laſt reſolution of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in matters of faith. But if the Pope can ſtretch out his power to ſuch definitions at home, in his owne Chaire, by his fire ſide; to what ſtrange end, I pray, is all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing from all parts, to Councels? All matters of faith, in their doctrine, are of equall moment; and ſlipping in one we go downe in all. And though every trouble be not ſo great, <hi>ut omnes vexenter nationes,</hi> that al Nations ſhould be troubled in the ſettling of it: yet exery growing trouble of faith, which cannot be laid by argument, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes; requires, that the whole body ſhould helpe the part in danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. Neither indeed, can a Councell among them, be a true judge of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. For they profeſſe, that although the Pope as Preſident of the Councell, is tied to joyne with the greater part of voyces; yet there is a reſervation behinde, that the Pope, though not as Preſident; yet as the chiefe Prince of the Church, may cancell the Acts of the Councell, reverſe the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152599:206"/> Decrees; and retract the judgement. So that in the marrow of the matter, the judgement of a Councell is nothing but a vaine flaſh of the Popes private opinion. And how ſtout he is in the defence of matters pertaining to the royalty of his owne greatneſſe; the whole world can teſtifie. And for that great controverſie, long toſſed and tumbled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, concerning the power of the Pope, over the temporall affaires of Princes: the Benedictine Monkes, our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, denyed lately the lawfulneſſe of ſuch a power. But in the iſſue of the matter, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jeſuits more potent, and themſelves ſliding downward into diſgrace; they drew back their necks ſoftly out of the ſnare, looked ſorrowfull one upon another, and repented of their errour.

It is not commendable in a Church-perſon, to be garded on both ſides with great Fans, from the impudencie of Waſpes and Flyes, and to keepe the winde away; to be uſhered with Trumpeters; to be honoured like an Emperour; to decke the head with more Crownes, then God promiſeth to his faithfull childe.

                  <p>ONe of my great admirations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is: that whereas there are many Churches yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, of great antiquity: and ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt was almoſt, if not altogether, as ſoone heard of, as in <hi>Rome:</hi> ſhe will not conſort, and comply with them in things, which were wholly in uſe amongſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians. If ſhe deſires with a Chriſtian deſire, and not with a deſire one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of her owne advancement to win them; why doth ſhe not come as neere to them, as it is moſt evident, they come to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church? This way of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was never Gods way. Which I will demonſtrate in a plaine diſcourſe, (though not plaine to the plaine) that I may a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſe my reader in his journey, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious objects. God, as he was ever God, ſo
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152599:209"/> he was ever good. For the moſt eminent Attribute of God (ſaith <hi>Dyonyſius</hi>) is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The nature of goodneſſe, is to ſpread, and diffuſe it ſelfe. And every good doth ſpread, and diffuſe it ſelfe according to the variety, and greatneſſe of goodneſſe, which it hath. And therefore, God the Father, being infinitely good, doth infinitely ſpread, and diffuſe himſelfe upon the Son. And the Father and Sonne, being infinitely good, doe infinitely ſpread, and diffuſe themſelves upon the holy Ghoſt. And if the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, doe not in any kinde ſpread and diffuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves infinitely upon the Angels, and us; it is becauſe, we being creatures, and by courſe of neceſſary conſequence, finite; are not capable of an infinite diffuſion. The Charity by which a good man loves good, might be infinite, if the ſubject could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. Now, as in the works of nature, and firſt diffuſion of his goodneſſe upon his creatures; God the firſt cauſe, would firſt worke by himſelfe, and himſelfe bring about the moſt weighty matter of making all theſe fine things of nothing: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, of waking nature out of her dead ſleepe in the <hi>Chaos:</hi> that it might appeare to us, who ſhould afterwards heare the grave, and ſtrange ſtory of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152599:210"/> that hee was all-ſufficient, and could not be at a fault, for want of help. Yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the continuance of the worke, it pleaſed him to uſe the meane aſſiſtance of ſecond cauſes; as of Angels, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; that he might adde worth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, by ſo great imployment. So likewiſe in the workes of Grace, and ſecond diffuſion of his goodneſſe upon his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the great worke of enfranchizing the world by his Bloud, himſelfe alone would performe: but in applying the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and vertue of his Paſſion to the choſen veſſels of honour, and mercie; he doth graciouſly call, in a manner, to his aide, Apoſtles, and Apoſtolicall men. And as God, being the Author of nature, fals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe, and workes with every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſecond cauſe, in a manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, agrreable to their naturall, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of working: So likewiſe, being the Author of Grace, and having never yet, (for ſome great reaſons, beſt knowne to himſelfe) made two men with a perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement either of face or nature; ſendeth Apoſtles, and Preachers; who have in their commands, a ſpeciall injunction of being<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22</note> like to him, who ſaith, <hi>I am made all things to all men, that I might by all meanes ſave ſome.</hi> And God himſelfe, not onely in executing

For Good is faire, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the cleare eye of reaſon beholdeth in it, at the firſt ſight, a ſingular conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the will of man, and a ſympathy with Heaven. And therefore, they who were bound onely with the looſer ties of the Law of nature; and who now in ſtrange Countries, and in wilde, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth places diſpenſe their actions by the light of reaſon, beare a Preacher in their hearts. Ill is blacke, and deformed, and

For, as the Beaſt runneth, the Bird flieth from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as the one prepareth his den, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his neſt: as they looke abroad for daily nouriſhment, provide carefully for their young; know, what will ſatisfie their cold of hunger; what coole their heate of thirſt; what complyeth with their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent appetites: follow the leading of their admirable properties; and by a ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, cheerefully performe the ſeverall acts of their nature: So man, ſince he dealt with the Tree of Knowledge, naturally knoweth good as oppoſed to evill, as he naturally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth light from darkneſſe. Againe: ſome things are good in themſelves, and not good onely, becauſe God commands them to be loved and imbraced: and theſe in the firſt place, the light of nature ſheweth to be good.

                  <p>ALl this while there occurred, as well in the booke of Creatures, as in the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letters from the Creatour, many faire, and ſolid emblems of a Divine providence, goodneſſe, wiſedome, mercie, juſtice, and ſo forth. And before this, man might alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy learne ſufficiently, that there was one God; even in the Manuſcript of Creatures, by turning before his leſſon, from cauſe to cauſe, till he came to the firſt cauſe; from motion to motion, till he came to the firſt Mover. But the capacity of the childiſh young world, was yet too meane, too ſhallow to receive in plaine language, the myſterious doctrine of a Trinity; the heart of man being, as it were, not yet altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfolded, not perfectly open'd into a Triangle. Nor did ever any ſpirituall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to this day, meete with the perfect
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152599:214"/> likeneſſe of the bleſſed Trinity in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For, there is no principle in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge, no foot-ſtep of God in Creatures; by the direction of which any created underſtanding, either Humane or Angelicall, may reaſonably cloſe with the aſſent, or opinion, or even ſuſpition of the bleſſed Trinity: or which can give us any true notice, that it is poſſible. For, although the Underſtanding, Will, and Memory of man; in which, as in the moſt during part, Gods image conſiſteth; are three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and one ſoule: yet they fall under being one and three, after the manner, as God is three and one: nor is there ſuch a difference in the faculties, as diſtinction in the Perſons. And if you diſtinguiſh the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties really, with the Thomiſts; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will not be ſo really diſtinguiſhed, and yet they will be truely diſtinguiſhed one from another; beſides that every one will be the ſame in Eſſence, and the whole Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152599:215"/> God was not willing to deliver the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the bleſſed Trinity in a plaine let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Jewes; but in characters, in a cloſe and covered manner: becauſe they firſt came from <hi>Egypt,</hi> where a multitude of Gods was adored; and were afterwards ſeated in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where the like adoration was performed. And if God had talked to them in a familiar way; in a worne, and beaten phraſe, of three Perſons; they moreover, being an idolatrous generation, their corrupt natures might have eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Text; and beleeved as many Gods as Perſons: eſpecially, when they were of themſelves, ſuch waxen creatures, ſo prone, and pliant to Idolatry; that the onely reaſon why they danced to a golden Calfe in the Wilderneſſe, was, becauſe they had formerly ſeene the like ſport, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in <hi>Egypt;</hi> when they were buſie, as it is recorded of them, in raiſing an Egyptian Pyramis. Yet God did often draw here a line and there a figure of this great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the old Teſtament: that it might not ſeeme to be new doctrine, when it ſhould afterwards be delivered with the ſound of a Trumpet in the new Teſtament. And que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe, we ſhall know in Heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in every degree, and latitude of the beatificall viſion, many great ſecrets, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152599:216"/> priviledged myſteries (though not in ſo high a kinde) which God is not pleaſed ever to reveale out of himſelf, to the world; in conſideration of humane weakneſſe, and diſtraction. This thrice high myſtery of the bleſſed Trinity, is onely fit nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an underſtanding thrice pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, thrice enlightned: that is, by the light of Nature, the light of the Law, and the light of the Goſpel: And onely we, by the onely helpe of Grace, can throughly digeſt it.

                  <p>Firſt, man was no ſooner man, but God faſtned himſelfe to him by Grace. Which Union, though it was not the Union of God with man, but of his Grace; yet Grace did preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the perſon of God: and while ſhee kept her Court in man, performed the ſtrict will of her Lord, her ſelfe, and ſo governed, that all the powers where ſhe was, did the ſame: <hi>Adam</hi> not falling ſinfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall. But God ſeeing that this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was quickly diſſolved in <hi>Adams</hi> fall; and that being a very unſettled Union, it was in danger to breake at every turne; and foreſeeing what we now ſee, he made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſure, and ſacred cord of Union, in the Incarnation; whereby humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is tied to the Divinity; and makes up the ſame Perſon with the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, without any danger of a divorce, or breach of friendſhip. But becauſe this Union is not the joyning of God to every man, but to the nature of man, and to no mans nature in particular, but his owne: he ſleepes not here, but comes home to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152599:220"/> every one without exception, in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; marrying himſelfe by grace, to the ſoule; applyed in the reſemblance of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nouriſhment; to make the Union of Grace more ſtrong with a double knot: as labouring, if it were poſſible, to turne into the ſoule, and be the ſame thing with it; as bread becomes not one of the two in <hi>carne una,</hi> in one fleſh; but <hi>una caro,</hi> one and the ſame fleſh, with the body.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we are not yet come to that, which by the Grecians is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The third, and laſt is given by the ſame hand, and happily to my purpoſe: becauſe hee moſt pleaded for the abrogation of the Moſaicall rites; of which, the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> though Chriſtians, were yet zealous,<note place="margin">Act. 21. 20.</note> as it is plaine in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. And therefore, leſt the mention of his name, ſhould breake the ſinewes, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the force, and energy of his doctrine; he is plyable to their paſſion, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, denies his owne name. And we know, that the wiſe Apoſtles in the Primitive Church, gave way to the Hebrewes in the uſe of many legall ceremonies, untill the full, and plenary promulgation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; that the Church might with more eaſe, be compacted of Jewes, and Gentiles; and the parts not ſtirred, cloſe the better.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Clement</hi> writes of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> the great Phariſee, and Doctor of the Law, that hee was left, being now a Chriſtian, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appointment of the Apoſtles, in the Councell of the Jewiſh Elders; to qualifie their heate, and mitigate their cruelty. And in the <hi>Acts,</hi> he acts his part; he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> with both ſides, and reach beyond them all.</p>
                  <p>This Milkie way went all the godly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, who ſucceeded the Apoſtles, or their Schollers, in all Churches: keeping an even

                  <p>This ever was, and is, and ever will bee, the knowne courſe of the holy Ghoſt, even in the ſoules of men: eſpecially, as he is, to borrow of <hi>Syneſius,</hi>

                  <p>He that is ſtung by a Tarantula, (I write what I have knowne) is preſently taken with a ſtrong, and violent fit of dancing: and he is beſt cured, when the Muſitian playes aptly with the current of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and bending of his fancie.

                  <p>AFter many ſtormie dangers, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtormes, by ſea and by land; I arrived ſafe into my deare Countrey, little <hi>England. My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord,</hi> for it. And me thoughts, I came out of the noiſe, and tumults of other Countries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> as into a ſilent harbour, and haven of reſt; having, as it were, left the world behinde mee: And if my compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may lawfully bring two different things together; as a ſoule going out of earth, comes into Heaven. Truely, after the firſt ſtep upon land, I kneeled downe, and kiſſed the very ſands, and gravell on the ſhore. Being come to <hi>London,</hi> I preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelfe to my ſuperiours; and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my faculties, declared whence I came. But they ſeemed fearfull, having heard that I had formerly ſuſpected their wayes. Yet, that was but a qualme, and I was quickly diſpoſed of; and my walke aſſigned to me.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152599:223"/> I was placed in a Pariſh, wherein there were and are many more Papiſts, then there are people in the Pariſh in which I am now ſeated. And they were many of them both rich, and of quality: There are all poore, and of a low name. Any man may beleeve without ſtraining his faith, that comming to <hi>England,</hi> ſo top-full of the knowledge of Romiſh abuſes, and corruptions; I wanted nothing, but the very laſt degree of heate to the taking of fire: I wanted but an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to ſet one wheele a going, that all the reſt might goe with it. I had gathered experience out of all their affaires, but onely, their dealings in <hi>England:</hi> And I deſired a little thence, to make up the Talent. In the houſe where I lived, all my imployment was, my ſervice of God in my way, and exerciſe in my ſtudies. I know my enemies will grant to me, that no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them followed his ſtudies with more exact diligence, then my ſelfe. But my way differed from theirs, for I alwayes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Schoole Divinity, and other learning, with an even hand before me; that the mildnes of the one might temper the aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the other; and that the ſoundneſſe of the one, might fortifie the weakneſſe of the other; and that one might bring the other downe to the underſtandings of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152599:223"/> to be inſtructed by me. They were all for the deepe of Divinity: All, for diving. Whence it comes, that few of them are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the converſion of ſoules (otherwiſe then by ſleight, and cunning;) or able in the faculty of preaching. In this houſe, I wrought the cure of a wound which many Prieſts had beene doing with, never any brought to a <hi>Citatrice</hi> but my ſelfe. I reaped the benefit of gifts in the houſe, (indeede they were thruſt upon me) yet not ſo great; but a great Prieſt, (the famous <hi>Divel-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>) whom I uſed in Counſell, ſecured to me, the taking of them in juſtice. Yet this kindled a quarrell; ſuch was the tenacious nature of the prime Litigant: and grew to a parting. And this for a parting blow: (perhaps, my Reader may underſtand it) <hi>Agnes,</hi> a tender ſoft Girle, having rejected the love of a noble young Romane, to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the heavenly Bridegroome; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to her Headſman with the voice of a man, as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> delivereth it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">

                  <p>MY Superiours now ſent me, and one of them brought me to one of their greateſt houſes in <hi>England,</hi> being the houſe of a very noble perſonage; where they were deſtitute of a Preacher. But I repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>London,</hi> while the matter was hot in debating; rumour had carried to their eares, that I had opened my heart to ſome Proteſtants of note, concerning my good will to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> which blew up all their hopes. For, ſome paſſages of the Countrey where I lived, which had paſſed in my time: had much bowed my heart to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of what I had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. The paſſages in part, were theſe: To confirme the doctrine of worſhip due to Images; it was ſpread amongſt the Papiſts, that the night before a certaine holy Prieſt was apprehended by a Purſevant, all the pictures in his chamber were ſeen to ſweat.</p>
                  <p>And to bolſter up the doctrine of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints; it was given out for a fixt truth; that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout perſon, being frighted in his bed, with the ſtrange likeneſſe of a Ghoſt; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152599:224"/> upon Chriſt by the holy name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; no helpe appeared: but at length, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſpeech to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Ghoſt with all poſſible haſte, vaniſhed. In theſe parts, a great Prieſt (great in body) being moſt talkative in his owne praiſes, perſwaded the weaker ſort of his faction, that he had already caſt foure hundred De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils out of a poore needy woman; by the vaine exorcizing of whom, ſet out with bold action, and a loud voice; he raiſeth to himſelfe, a great part of his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For, he carrieth her from houſe to houſe; as poore men doe Apes; to ſhew tricks with her. And he had tooke much paines to releaſe her, in the houſe where I lived. It is eaſie to delude fooles; but, that wiſe perſons ſhould goe aſtray after a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would be a contradiction in wiſdome; and prove, that wiſedome were not ſo well united in it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>I was preſent one time, when the play was acted. For, the fat Prieſt had gathered together the refuſe of Papiſts, being the poore ſilly ſheep of people, (I dare ſay, not one of them knew the biggeſt letter in the Alphabet) into a houſe ſtanding alone. He ſate in a Chaire, habited with his Prieſts ornaments. The woman kneeled at his frete; and turned her mouth, and face in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152599:225"/> ſtrange figures. He ſpoke to the Devill, with a commanding voice: the Devill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the woman. He asked the Devill, how many Devils had poſſeſſion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; The Devill anſwered, all were gone of ſo many hundreds, but onely two. Hee commanded the Devill to come up to the top of her longeſt finger: He did ſo, and the finger was held out. Having got him there, he asked him his name. The Devill anſwered, in a grave tone, <hi>Dildo.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the other to the ſame place; and likewiſe, asked his name: This Divell alſo anſwered, <hi>Dildo.</hi> But there the womans wit fell ſhort; for, ſhe ſhould have given the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Devill, another name. And here was all that is notable, which I ſaw in the beſt part of a night; who notwithſtanding, was very curious in ſeeing. And in the word of an honeſt man, I ſaw nothing, but what might eaſily be; and what reaſon tels me, was counterfeit. And all the while the poore ignorant people were all on their knees, praying upon their Beads, knocking their breſts, groaning as loud as the Patient; &amp; crying, Our bleſſed Lady help thee. The root of the deceit, is: They ſay, the Devill firſt entred into her, when ſhe entred into one of our Churches, to ſee the childe of a Papiſt buried; to which ſhee had beene
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152599:225"/> Nurſe. And ſtill, the wonders pluck at our doctrine, as here people are frighted from entring into our Churches, for feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſed with Devils. The plaine ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple truth is, (which I made good by enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) The woman was alwayes a very idle, and lazie perſon; and the childe failing, grew poore, and diſcontented; and ſo, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell to her tricks, or was eaſily wrought into them. I am a ſaver here, as in other places. Onely, this I preſent to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all wiſe people: If one ſmall part of a County in the ſmall time of a yeere, gave plenty of theſe moſt ridiculous paſſages: what prankes doe they play eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houre in <hi>England?</hi> what in the world? I kenw the Jeſuite that came to the dore of a great houſe in <hi>England;</hi> leading an Ape, and profeſſing to make ſport with him; The ſecret was, he deſired to win a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of his, abiding in the houſe. To whom afterwards comming, as ſhe walked in the fields in hay-time, and not being able to bend her to him, he drew his knife upon her; and had ſhee not beene relieved by an out-cry, ſhe might have beene ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him, of her life, though not of her religion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and the like ſtrange carriages of heavenly matters, ſcanned in my thoughts,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152599:226"/> moved me at firſt, to ſeparate my ſelfe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from the Papiſts. In which time, they wrote a very perſuaſive letter to me. Which having peruſed, I ſent a letter to a perſon of quality amongſt them; wherein (for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the beginning of my book, to ſpeak the truth in all things) I ſignified to him, that my heart failed me, and I feared to goe on, in my new reſolution. And in ſo great a change, as the change of Religion; after the practice of thirteene yeeres amongſt the Papiſts, and all the yeeres of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; it would have beene a miracle, if the heart ſhould not have imitated the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Needle, turning to the North-pole, and have ſhaked before it had fixt. Yet this hapned before I had actually tooke the the habit of a Miniſter. Let them ſhew mee, that I gave them any ſolid ſhew, I was of their minde, ſince I firſt made open ſhew of the profeſſion, I now ſticke to; and they will ſhew more, then they can ſhew.</p>

                  <p>I Beganne ſoone after, to compare the two Religions; in theſe words. The Proteſtants have one great Power, upon whom onely they depend; and to whom
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152599:226"/> alone, they flie by prayer in all their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; obſerving that of Saint <hi>Peter, Caſt all</hi>

                     <hi>your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> The Papiſts have as many hearers, and helpers, as they have Saints and Angels. And yet, devotion being divided, is leſſe warme: and the expectation of a benefit from a heavenly power under God, doth engage us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the higheſt acts; at leaſt of outward reverence to a creature; as, to proſtrate our ſelves before him, and to call upon him in all places, as if he were every where. The Proteſtants leane wholly upon the merits of Chriſt Jeſus; deſiring to ſuit with that of Saint <hi>Paul, For by Grace yee are ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves: it</hi>

And yet, as no man can direct an intention to an end, but hee muſt alſo intend the meanes, requiſite to the end: So, no man can truly merit ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſſe he likewiſe merit the meanes neceſſary to ſalvation: the thing neceſſary to ſalvation, was the death of Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">

                     </note> if they merit ſalvation, they merited likewiſe the death of Chriſt. But Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neque enim illum ad nos merita
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152599:227"/> noſtra bona, ſed peccata duxerunt:</hi> our merits did not draw him to us, but our ſinnes. The Proteſtants have onely two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; becauſe Chriſt intended to give life, and to maintaine it: They have Baptiſme, to give ſpirituall life; and the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, or the Lords Supper, to keepe and cheriſh it. The Papiſts have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sacraments, as there are ſeven Planets, and becauſe there are ſeven deadly ſinnes. And yet, if every viſible ſigne of an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible gift, be a Sacrament; the old Law was exceedingly ſtored with Sacraments. The Proteſtants give Chriſt to be eaten by faith: the Papiſts wholly, and carnally; and in the ſame manner, as he is in Heaven. And therefore, the ſacred inſtitution is maimed, and the poore Laity deprived of the Cup; becauſe they are beleeved to take all Chriſt his body, <hi>ex vi verborum;</hi> and his bloud, ſoule, Divinity; and the bleſſed Trinity it ſelfe, <hi>per concomitantiaem,</hi> in regard that Chriſt cannot be parted.

                     <hi>in ſubjection with all gravity.</hi> Both the Biſhop, and Prieſt with the Papiſts, profeſſe to live a moſt Angelicall life, and to carry
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152599:227"/> with them out of the world, an unſpotted robe of chaſtity. And yet, while they bring glory to their Church by a compulſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the Clergy from an honeſt, and lawfull act, they ruine the precious ſoules of many thouſands of thouſands: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the great and grievous complaints of many devout perſons in the Councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> and by the beaten, and ordinary practiſe of their Prieſts; who by force tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the true channell, runne over all bankes, into all beaſtlineſſe. And I have from their owne mouths, two matters of notable importance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that indeed, marriage had beene granted to Prieſts in the Councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> had they not, upon the ſuggeſtion of the Jeſuits, feared poverty, and contempt: By which, it is as cleere as Gods Sunne, that they more aime in their adventures at the glory of the Church, their viſible Mother, then of God, their inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Father.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Jeſuits hewed the Councell into this conceit, for this end; leſt, becauſe the Jeſuits can throw off their habit at their pleaſure, all their able men ſhould have left them, and runne a wiving. And it is a great reaſon, of a great rule they have; that no Jeſuit may be a Biſhop, or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152599:228"/> Cardinall, without an extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and diſpenſation from the Pope; becauſe their houſes would then be deplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Schollers.</p>
                  <p>I feare, the religious perſons of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> clad ſo meanely; in the greater part, thinke themſelves as great, as the greateſt. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of <hi>Diogenes, Superbos Platonis thoros, alia ſuperbia decul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,</hi> he kicks the pride of <hi>Plato,</hi> being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<note place="margin">Tert. <hi>Apol. cap. 46.</hi>
                     </note> as proud as he. The Proteſtants are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies humble ſuppliants to God, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſinnes; and ſtill laying open before him, and recounting the ſins of their youth: And the uncertainty holds them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a feare, and trembling, and in a meeke ſubmiſſion to God.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt in Confeſſion, will give to the Papiſts, a full, and abſolute forgiveneſſe of all their ſinnes; whenſoever they pleaſe to read, or tell them over. And yet nothing is more dangerous to an ignorant ſoule, then a deceitfull ſecurity: they beleeve their ſinnes are forgiven, and the care is paſt. Confeſſion cannot be neceſſary, <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate abſoluta;</hi> that is, neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or in the liſt of Sacraments. For, why did the Greeke Church, the moſt devout, and moſt learned Church in the world, and the Nurſery of our greateſt Doctors, moved
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:152599:228"/> onely with one abuſe uſhered by Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aboliſh it? Can the abuſe of a Sacrament amongſt reaſonable creatures, and ſenſible of their owne condition, deface the uſe of it? And therefore doubtleſſe, they held it by the title of a good, and pious cuſtome; not in the name of a Sacrament. Turne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way: God, who commandeth every ſervant of his, to keepe the dores of his ſenſes; and by all honeſt violence, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the entrance of ſinne upon the ſoule; will he give a Sacrament, wherein the ſoule ſhal under the pretty color of ſanctity ſtand open to all kindes of uncleanneſſe? And he that commandeth me to ſhut my eares againſt lewd diſcourſes; will he now, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe himſelfe, and command me to heare them? They reply, the relations are now in mourning, and delivered in a dolorous, and humble manner. But, the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing catching, we cannot be too cautious; and it is not likely, that God would linke a holy Sacrament, with a knowne tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a knowne truth, that theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and eſpecially, of women, when they relate the Acts, and circumſtances of their fleſhly ſinnes, doe make ſtrange mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not onely in the minds, but alſo, in the bodies of their Prieſts; which their Authors confeſſe, even out of Confeſſion.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152599:229"/> Confeſſion, as they uſe it, is an optick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, through which, they looke neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſoule; that according to that ſight, they may governe. And therefore, it is one of the private rules amongſt the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; that in all their conſultations, (which are many) the Bell having rung them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Ghoſtly Father eſpecially, ſhall be preſent, and his counſell moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And although the Generals of their Orders, checked by the Popes, have given publike commands to the contrary: yet they are all but a face, and a flouriſh. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, thought a Sacrament, is to many, the bane of perfection: For, leaning hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon the pretended ſtrength, and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the abſolution, they bate much of the ſorrow, which is the principall part of true repentance.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants keepe one day in the weeke holy, in obedience to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, given with a <hi>Memento; Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy;</hi> and other<note place="margin">Euod. 20. 8.</note> ſpeciall dayes, according to an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſquared by the rule of the ancient Church.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts have many Holy-dayes, and yet doe not ſeriouſly obſerve the Sabbath, inſomuch, that the Jeſuits boaſt, their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have complained much of Sabbath-breaking.

Firſt keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then, let your devotion ſtretch as God ſhall enable it. In this point, they are like themſelves, when they ſay their prayers; For, let my Reader imagine, that he ſeeth two perſons on their knees, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The one ſpeaketh diſtinctly, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up his eyes, hands, heart, and voice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and in a fit time maketh an end: The other looketh here and there, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with his tongue and lips ſo faſt, that apprehenſion cannot over-take him; talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with any man, and then againe, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away with his lips; but ſtayeth long in his prayer. Which now of theſe prayers is moſt acceptable to the Divine will?</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards have a form of ſalutation which is alwayes uſed as a prologue to their diſcourſes; and it is ever the ſame, both in words and forme; and it conſiſteth of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſentences, one anſwering to another. And it is pretty matter of mirth, to heare how they runne it over: Even ſo the Papiſts deale with their Latin prayers, when they recite (as the terme is) ſo many <hi>Pater-noſters,</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:152599:230"/> and ſo many <hi>Ave-Maries.</hi> And theſe Latin prayers were but an earthly invention of man, with a politicke purpoſe, to keepe all Churches in Union with the Latin Church, and in ſubjection to it. I pity the poore Nuns, that ſpend more then halfe their time of waking in running over, what they underſtand not. And I have ſome pitie for the Engliſh Papiſts, who are taught, that it is an act of greater merit, to pray in Latin, though not underſtood, then in Engliſh: becauſe it hath more of obedience, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affinity, and is more coincident with Church-ſervice. The Proteſtants quarrell about ceremonies. But the Popiſh Prieſts, in my knowledge, have oppoſed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſuch a tumultuous manner, that they drew on both ſides, great perſons, and whole States into their faction; once againe verifying that of <hi>Pliny; Montes duo inter ſe</hi>

                  <p>The Papiſts ground much upon mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and yet confeſſe the world hath beene much deluded by them. I have beene reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the ſpace of eight yeares, a quarter of my age, in their chiefeſt, and moſt eminent Cities, and places of abode; and yet, was never preſent at the working of a Miracle. Beſides, the working of Miracles, is not an undeceivable ſigne of the true Faith. God hath wrought Miracles by an Heretick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: yea, by the old Romans; for example, in the defence of the innocent; or, to give waight, and authority to a cloſe, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered truth. What if I ſhould grant, that the Papiſts may worke Miracles, in the proofe of the doctrine, which teacheth a Trinity of perſons in the God-head; the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt; the redemption of the world, by the ſhedding of his bloud? But I will not bee ſo liberall. Yet, God hath wrought Miracles by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152599:231"/> and unbeleeving people, though not to ſanctifie their wickedneſſe, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their unbeliefe.</p>

And long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his dayes, Saint <hi>Juſtine</hi> the Martyr, was of the ſame minde; <hi>Licet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haeretici miracula faciant, hoc tamen non confirmat haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticos in errore, quia miraculorum effectio non ſemper eſt pietatis ſignum, &amp; demonſtratio, ut Dominus oſtendit cum ei dicunt, Domine non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in nomine tuo prophetavimus?</hi> Although Hereticks worke Miracles, this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth not confirme them in their errour, becauſe the working of Miracles is not alwayes an infallible demonſtration of piety, as Chriſt ſheweth, when they ſay to him, <hi>Lord, have we not in thy name Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, caſt out Devils?</hi> The Papiſts have the name of good, and recollected people. I can paſſe my judgement, not upon the hearts, but upon the lives of three Families, which I ſaw. One of which was wholly taken up with ſporting, gaming, hunting, revelling. The Maſters of the other were Spaniards in all their diſcourſes, rather then Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; which I was ſorry to heare: And one of them, frequented our Churches with his body, but not with his heart:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152599:232"/> otherwiſe, they were morall men. But <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> ſpeakes as if he knew them: <hi>Multo nocentior eſt haereticus bonae vitae, &amp; plus in doctrina ſua habet authoritatis, eo qui doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam converſatione maculat:</hi> An Heretick of a good life, is much more hurtfull, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth more authority to his doctrine, then he that ſpotteth his doctrine with his life. And afterwards, <hi>Idcirco ſollicite caveamus haereticos, qui converſationis optimae ſunt, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum forte vitam non tam Deus, quam Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus inſtruxit:</hi> Therefore, let us take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed of Hereticks, who are of a refined converſation, whoſe lives perhaps, not God, but the Devill hath-ordered. Their very orders of Religions are even frivolous in many points of their Inſtitutions: For, if they fore-ſee a ſinne in the exerciſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, they may not queſtion the ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of the command. And both they and their Prieſts may with more leave, and a leſſe breach of Law, commit Fornication, or Adultery, or Sodomy, or beaſtiality, a thouſand times over, then marry; although Gods Law was antecedent to their vow of chaſtity, and is of more validity; yea, though we ſhould grant their vow, as the vow to be ratified (with ſome limitation) by another Law of God, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the vow, is of greater perfection. It
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152599:232"/> came from the Monke of <hi>Doway,</hi> that not long agoe, it was a cuſtome in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and obſerved with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe of diligence; that every man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving married a wife, ſent her the firſt night to the Prieſt of the Pariſh.

                  <p>HAving thus boldly behaved my ſelfe in the open Field, the Popiſh Prieſts, and Papiſts; beganne to let their tongues goe at me with all their power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife threw ſlanders after <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> flying from her.

The Crocodiles are ſaid to beate themſelves, when they have loſt their prey. Let the Crocodile correct himſelfe: but let him ſpare me.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt advertiſe my Reader, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152599:236"/> before the advertiſement, I will conſider, that my Creatour, my Redeemer, and my Judge, is preſent with me, and obſerves how I manage my Pen. The Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the continuance of it, ſtands upon theſe two maine props, as upon two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pillars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ſpreading, and dilating of their praiſes, who fight under their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the vilifying, and debaſing of thoſe, who take armes againſt them. And it is to me a certainty, that the world lies drown'd in the bottome of theſe two great flouds; and is utterly ignorant, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have beene able, and good; what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, for theſe many ages. Their end is: The hearts of people, prepoſſeſſed with evill rumours, will be ſo filled with them; that the doctrine of him, upon whom the rumours attend, ſhall either have no place, or a very poore one: And ſuch a perſon, or the good in him, ſhall ever be looked upon, through the rumour; which like a falſe Glaſſe, ſhall make a ſtrange creature of him. It is with the Popiſh Prieſts amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that knowing one another ſo well, they know not how to inſtill a beliefe into one another, of what they ſay. I will give onely a ſoft touch or two; becauſe they
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152599:236"/> are very ſore in this part. The Jeſuits had a Scholler, when I was their Scholler, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for a Jeſuit; and they voiced of him, that every word which came from him in his exerciſes, was worthy to be written in gold. They had another Scholler whoſe thoughts were not with the Jeſuits, and he being gone, they gave out a rumour, that he was in opinion an <hi>Adamite;</hi> and held, that we ought (and might with leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſinning) to conforme our ſelves, in the matter of apparell, to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before their fall. The man branded with this rumour, is now a Prieſt, and a Priſoner in <hi>England;</hi> but a plaine one: and as free from any ſuch imagination, as the beſt of us all. If they be thus miſchievous at their owne home; what ſhall become of me, that have another home; ſet up, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their home? Where true Faith is the Miſtreſſe, Chriſtian ſimplicity is ever a a waiter: But falſhood is weake, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wanting; and as ſhe is falſe, ſo are all her attendants; and all her wayes. The Schollers in the Seminaries, beleeve nothing of the ſame ranke, more truely, then that Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> who wrote the Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge, was of ſo weake a braine, that hee thought his head was an Vrinall; and if it touched a thing of a hard ſubſtance, it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152599:237"/> would breake. Is not this a pretty way to transforme people into a belief, that all the doctrine and hiſtory, which came out of that head, was no better then Urinall proofe? A perſon of worth, and great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue amongſt the Proteſtants, wrote againſt them: And if I have eares, they reported he was tooke in the baſe act of Fornication with a poore Blackamore drudge: They would not grant him the honour to have dealt with a Woman of his owne skinne. Was not this a deepe way to perſwade, that his booke was begot betwixt him, and the Devill! I heard the man named, who wrote the book in the name of Biſhop King on his death-bed. The Biſhop was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed: And yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot bluſh.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot ſtay upon this Dung-hill; becauſe I ſee more foule way, in my way concerning my ſelfe.</p>

                  <p>THey reported ſo baſely of me, in the matter of my departure from them, and from the place of my reſidence in the Countrey: that I was forced to repaire to the Maſter of the houſe, for a teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152599:237"/> his hand, of my religious demeanour; who being a direct man in his way, gave it me in ample manner; and freed me both from the ſinne, and the ſuſpition of it on his part. And I can make it evident to any middle, and indifferent perſon, that I could not have proceeded otherwiſe, either in reaſon, or juſtice, or prudence; all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered; and my knowledge of the preſent condition of things: And yet, they have not feared to report a moſt execrable falſhood: that the Maſter of the houſe tooke me in bed with his wife; and vehemently proteſted, that if I had not beene a ſacred perſon, a Prieſt, hee would have killed me. And that the matter might ſeeme more colourable, they imployed a Miniſter of the ſame Countrey, a friend of theirs, and a wilde one; and a man of all companies, to make it his pot-diſcourſe: who in this, was not Chriſts Miniſter, but theirs, and the Devils. How much hath poore <hi>England</hi> ſuffered, and how long groaned under ſuch Miniſters, divided in their owne hearts, and torne betwixt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Proteſtants: neither altogether faithfull to one, nor wholly true to the other. Albeit I am ſure, that as in all great workes; ſo eſpecially in the ſervice of God, the heart muſt be united in it ſelfe, that it
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152599:238"/> may be more ſtrong in its motion.</p>
                  <p>But to turn upon the report: I may uſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary words, becauſe I am extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily charged: As I ſhall ever deſire to partake, either of the promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or of the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, no ſuch thing, nor yet any ſhadow of it, was true. And in my conſcience, I cannot taxe the Gentlewoman with any thing, but fondneſſe, and indiſcretion; to which, the ſexe is very prone; and which ſhee hath practiſed upon more then my ſelfe. Witneſſe the witneſſes of our converſation, which either were of the houſe, or of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. Thinke now, into what troubled ſtreames he throwes himſelfe, that kicks off <hi>Rome,</hi> and twines with the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> If he be not ſupported with ſtrong hands, both inwardly, and outwardly; in truth, in truth, he floats upon a very cold, and comfortleſſe condition. What then, when his owne Brethren make him the jeſt and contempt of men, halfe metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into beaſts? But this was little to what came after. It was proclaimed with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cry, that I was madde; and that I, and my wits had beene parted this many a yeare. But O my Father of Heaven, I thank thee, I have them ſtill: and my joy is, that as they were in thy gift, ſo they are in thy
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152599:238"/> keeping. If they anſwer: theſe were the noiſes of common people; and rumours are no ſooner hatched, but they have long feathered wings. What ſay they to the Scotch Prieſt in <hi>Holborne,</hi> who reported to certaine Proteſtants, that I was runne away with the mans wife, in whoſe houſe I lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And they doubting of it; doe yee thinke, (ſaid he) that I know it not, who lodge very neere to him? This rumour was diſcovered in the mouth, where it was firſt borne. Having preached in Saint <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Church, I was no ſooner out of the Pulpit, but the Reader deſired me to ſatisfie him in one particular; and related, that he had ſpoke a day or two before, with an honeſt, and moderate Papiſt; who aſſured him, that in the beginning of the weeke, I had raviſhed a maid; and ſuch a Juſtice, naming a Gentleman in <hi>Holborne,</hi> had ſent me to <hi>Newgate.</hi> And they were as buſie in the Countrey. For, a Countrey-Papiſt came to my lodging; enjoyned by his friends, to ſee me: Truely (ſaid he) it is credibly reported, and beleeved in the Countrey, that you are dead, having cut your throat. O <hi>Rome,</hi> canſt thou maintaine thy greatneſſe by no better meanes? Then, thou art a wretched <hi>Rome</hi> indeed; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the houre in which I left thee. And
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152599:239"/> lately, when by reaſon of ſome words in my Pariſh, vomitted out of the black mouth of a Popiſh ſervant, in the diſhonour, both of me, and our Religion. I wrote to his Maſter, deſiring that my Pariſhioners might not be ſtirred in their ſervice of God, or averted from their allegiance to the King: inſerting theſe words concerning my ſelfe. <hi>Set aſide the ſweete name of Chriſt, I would rather chooſe to be a Turke then a Papiſt.</hi> I deſcerned no change in the working of my letter; but only, that I was defamed through the Countrey, and propoſed as one that had more inclination to Turcifme, then to Chriſtianity in them; that part which qualified the propoſition, <hi>ſet aſide the ſweet name of Chriſt,</hi> being wholly concealed, and ſet aſide in the report and my intention e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated. The occaſion of my inſerting that clauſe was, becauſe the Popiſh ſervant had ſaid, he was ſure that I would quickly bee theirs againe; which is alwayes a great part of their plea, when the man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from them, is circumſpect in his life. I ſee, that where one notorious abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dwels, all other ſinnes are neighbours.</p>
                  <p>This my letter was ſhewed by the Papiſts, to one of my owne cloth, and profeſſion. But one, whom the Papiſts have bought and ſeal'd their ſpeciall friend by ſpeciall
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152599:239"/> benefits, and entertainments. He ſpeaking as affection prompted him, not as Religion: ſo farre helped them on, both in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in their depreſſion of me; that he perſwaded them, the propoſition which they had choſe for the inſtrument of their abuſes, <hi>Set aſide the ſweete name of Chriſt, I had rather be a Turke then a Papiſt;</hi> to be no other thing, but elegant nonſenſe. His reaſons were, as I received them from his owne mouth: Firſt, becauſe the ſweete name of Chriſt could not be ſet aſide. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the propoſition being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into the ſenſe of it, if it hath any, is this: <hi>Set aſide the ſweete name of Chriſt, I had rather be a Turke then a Chriſtian.</hi> I reply: This is the diſcourſe of fleſh and bloud, or rather, of hunger and thirſt, and wanton appetite. Were there the greateſt of all connexions betwixt the name of Chriſt, and the Popiſh Religion, I might borrow of the Philoſophers, an hypotheticall, and imaginary ſeparation, <hi>per impoſſible.</hi> But, my meaning in the inwards, is; I doe not conceive, there is any mighty buſineſſe of Chriſt amongſt the Papiſts, but his name; and that whereſover it is, is a ſweete name, and a name without a thing, will eaſily be removed by an <hi>Intellectus agens.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will ſtand as cloſe, as this mans
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152599:240"/> tongue does to the Papiſts, <hi>Set aſide the ſweete name of Chriſt, I had rather bee a Turke then a Papiſt.</hi> And his ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is moſt injurious to his owe Religion, I meane the Religion which he profeſſeth; For it comes with a long taile, and implies, that nothing is ſignified by the word Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, but Chriſtian, they being <hi>termini con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibiles:</hi> and that every tenent of Popery, is Chriſtian, and derived from Chriſt. But, the wonder is, that I am forced to defend my propoſitions, and aſſertions, by which I diſclaime Popery, againſt a Brother. The Father of Heaven, in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt bleſſe, and continue the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> or many a faire birth-right will be ſold for a meſſe of Pottage. Two things I have learn'd, and experience was my Schoole-miſtreſſe, ſpeaking to me from the lives of others: The firſt is, that to divide and rend our ſelves betwixt two Religions, is the neareſt path to Atheiſme. And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that men ſo rent &amp; divided, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany-keepers, lovers of pleaſure, hunters, gamſters, <hi>&amp; caet.</hi> And by ſuch, I ſhall joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be reſiſted; having ſo good an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that I fight Gods battels.</p>
                  <p>And that the Papiſts may riſe as high as ſcandall can mount: they have ſpread into the world, that I have tooke one of their
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:152599:240"/> Prieſts, by whoſe hands God hath beene very kinde to me. To this, I thus anſwer: Firſt, that my obligation to my Prince, the State, and the Parliament, being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body of the whole Kingdome, doth binde me farre more ſtrictly, then the private kindneſſes betwixt friend and friend. Secondly, as I deſire to be waſhed with the bloud of Chriſt, I had no hand in the taking of that perſon, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. The man I tooke, was one from whom I was utterly diſintereſſed; a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſon, a ſcandall-raiſer, and one by whoſe practiſes I am as ſicke to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, as I would bee dead to its ſinnes. The other my <hi>quondam</hi> friend, I could have taxed in a fit place of this book, for his wily dealings with a maid, ſaid to be poſſeſſed with a Devill; and related, that the Devill lurking in a lump of her fleſh, would runne from part to part, and could not endure to be touched with his fingers, uſed in the touch of the conſecrated Hoſt. But I ſpared my friend.</p>
                  <p>I could be copious, if I ſhould not bee tedious, in theſe relations. Old wives tales are odious: And Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> taxeth <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtata, for blowing the coales at the Devils Altar, with old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. How their wiſedome is confounded!
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:152599:241"/> It is vainely done of the Pelican, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her neſt fired by Shepheards, commeth in all haſte, and thinking to redeeme her young from the danger; by the waving of her wings; bloweth the fire, and encreaſeth the flame: and at laſt, applying her whole body, loſeth her wings, the ſafety of her body.</p>
                  <p>And theſe reports are in effect, the ſame: The flame of my devotion towards the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is increaſed; and they loſe their wings, and themſelves in the fire: when doubtles, they thought to ſcape away (like the Fiſh) in the black inke, they caſt round about them, upon their brother. O theſe reports! They goe, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſaies of the waves in the Sea, one confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tumbling over the back of another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtop, or intermiſſion. And he that flyeth from <hi>Babylon,</hi> is like one of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in the Primitive Church Church, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in a brazen Bull. The bellowing, and roaring that you heare, is, in the thing it ſelfe, the voice of the Martyr; but much altered by paſſing through the wide throate of the brazen Bull. The torments of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Arathuſius,</hi> were ſtrange ones; deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed<note place="margin">
                        <hi>S.</hi> Greg. Naz. <hi>orat. 3 in</hi> Julian.</note> by Saint <hi>Gregory, Nazianzen.</hi> The vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old man was drawn through the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, &amp; through all ſorts of unclean places.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152599:241"/> He was hung up by the armes, and toſſed from ſide to ſide, where the boyes ſtood with Pen-kifes, to receive his naked body. He was drawne up in a basket, in the heate of a burning day; and all ſpread with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to gather a meeting of Bees upon his body. But he was happy: And happy were the Martyrs, who prayed, and meditated, walking upon hot fiery coales, as upon Roſes. I complained to one of them, of theſe ſcandals. And it was anſwer'd, that I might be called an Adulterer, a Raviſher, and the like; becauſe I had defiled the Spouſe of Chriſt, and turned to a Harlot. But why then is the crime delivered without the comment?</p>
                  <p>Some dayes after the publication of my cloſing with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſt came to me, having in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, one habited like an Engliſh Miniſter: and the maine point of his buſineſſe broke out in theſe words: See how God provides for his Church; you have left us, and here is one comming to us from that, for the love of which, you forſooke us. And thus ſpeaking, he pointed to the Miniſter. The Gentleman is now beneficed with us, and therefore you ſhall not know his name, though you are acquainted with his fault, becauſe God hath hid many of my faults
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:152599:242"/> from thoſe that know my name. Yet I like not, that he ſo much ſavoureth of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh practiſe, as to ſtigmatize me with the brand of inſufficiencie in matter of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereſoever he commeth. For, if he were come quite home to us, hee would be <hi>one heart and ſoule</hi> with me: and draw the practiſe of his life more neare to his parts, both of nature and learning: in both which, whatſoever I am, he is not unable: though both he and the Prieſt were of a moſt horrid life.</p>
                  <p>Let Men and Angels heare me: If any member of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> can make it plaine to the reaſon of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and fit Judges; that from the day wherein I firſt gave my necke into the yoke of the Papiſts, to this houre; I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any ſcandalous action, ſcandalous in the judgement of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and moreover, have not lived a wary, ſober, and recluſe life: I will reſtore againe, the little I have received from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and begge my bread, all the dayes of my life. Let them goe to my lodging-places in the City, and to my Pariſh in the Countrey (they are well knowne) and when they come home againe, convince me either of immodeſty, intemperancie, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or other ſuch crime; and I will turne
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152599:242"/> begger in the very day of my conviction. And yet I know, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will ſet mee out, (and Reader, remember my Prophecie) in the forme of a fooliſh, madde, ignorant, ſhallow, and odiouſly wicked creature. And I am all this, but they know it not. And even now, I play the foole; for, in the defence of my ſelfe, I commend my ſelfe. But I truſt, my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rather to defend the honour of the Church, from which, I did once cut my ſelfe, and to which, God hath joyned mee againe. I have heard it ſpoke in the corners of their Colledges; that they preſently write the lives of perſons, who revolt from them; and put them, and their actions in a ſtrange habit. I ſhall be joyfull to reade my life; that I may weepe for my ſinnes, and bleſſe God for my deliverances; but if it be not written truely, he will write it, that beſt knowes it. If they come with falſhoods, I ſhall more and more deteſt them, and their Religion; and beleeve, that all their good purpoſes in the ſervice of God, are but Velleities, Wils, and no Wils; Wils which would, but will not. I deſire peace, if it may be granted, with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. I was bound to ſatisfie good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtop the mouths of the evill. To many hath beene denied the uſe of a ſword;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152599:243"/> but no man ever was prohibited to uſe a buckler; becauſe a bucklar is ordained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for defence: and in our defence we kill; and yet are not thought to commit murder.</p>

                  <p>GGD hath brought me home with a mighty hand.

The Ship in where I was, ranne a whole night laid all a long upon one of her ſides: And another time, began to ſinke down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: I fell into the hands of theeves by the Sea-ſhore, that would have killed mee: and all in my journey towards <hi>England.</hi> And after all this, and much more, I am a convert to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in a time which needs a man of a bold heart, and a good courage like my ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to reſiſt the craft, encroaching, and intruſion of Popery. Let a great Papiſt remember his ordinary ſaying, that he beleeved God would worke ſome great worke by me. And I have great
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152599:243"/> hope that the Church wilbe pleaſed to look upon me, and fixe me, where I may beſt be ſeene; and moſt be heard. I am not of their minde, that move, and ſue, and labour, in the atchievement of that, which ought to bee caſt upon them.

And though the Dove alſo went out of the Arke; yet, becauſe ſhe could not finde cleane footing, ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: and <hi>He put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the Arke.</hi> How ready the good old man was? Hee met her with his hand, and tooke hold of her, leſt the weary thing ſhould fall; and ſuccoured her weakneſſe with his ſtrength, and pulled her in; and did not leave her in uncertainties; but pulled her unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This man knew how to carry his hand in Gods Arke. But, what became of the Crow? The Crow (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>) faſtned upon the floating carcaſſes of men, beaſts, and birds; there feaſted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted himſelfe (abroad, out of the Arke, and in the midſt of the troubled waters) with filth, and carrion. The Papiſts lay to our charge; that no man goeth from them to us, but with a deſire of more liberty, and licentiouſneſſe. I am certaine, that ſome have done ſo; whom the Devill hath toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from one extremity to another; from a roughneſſe, which God requires not; to a rudeneſſe which he hates. But, theſe have begun to be rude privately amongſt them; and then, have rather turned Atheiſts, then
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152599:245"/> Proteſtants. And many have runne Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> courſe, who having rejected the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees, and betook himſelfe to the Church of God; became a ſtout Defender of the one, and a ſtrong oppoſer of the other. God call'd me, and I heard him: he brought me, and I came: And being ſafe come, I ſhall be valiant. Though a Partridge ſteale the egges of her neighbour Partridge; hatch them, and bring them up; yet, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the young Partridge ſhall heare the call of his true mother; though he was taken from her in the egge, before hee could ſee her, or heare her, and before he was a Partridge; he will forſake his falſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and her covey, and drawne by a kind of ſecret correſpondence, returne preſently to the true one. And ſo have I. I thanke the Prieſt, that offered me entertainment at <hi>Doway,</hi> and there, the honour to be made Doctor, if I would law downe the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>England:</hi> But I am well here, both ſoule and body, it ſhall ſuffice me for this world, that I can be a Doctor, both here<note place="margin">

Fire will burne, and burning is intolerable; when your fleſh fries, you will tell me another tale.

And for Beaſts, you may ſee every day, they have teeth, and jawes, and clawes too, and are commonly hungry; and know not how to be mercifull, becauſe they want reaſon, by which, mercie is knowne to be mercie; and a Lion is not a ſociable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; he will roare, you may heare him a great while before you can ſee him. And what is the breaking of the bones, thou mayeſt give a gueſſe, if ever thou had'ſt but one out of joynt; they will ake, when they are broken. Judge of the reſt. Theſe miſchievous things are not throughly knowne, and conceived in the ſoule, till they are throughly knowne and felt in the body.

                  <p>And that I may fore-ſtall, and prevent an occaſion of idle diſcourſe, I will take off the ſeeming edge of a colourable objection. Perhaps, it may be ſaid; that I have ſcattered a word now and then, (and even in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) againſt thoſe, that now appeare to be the cleaner, and moſt uncorrupt part of Chriſtians: Thoſe I mean, whom injurious tongues call Puritanes. I call the world to witneſſe, and anſwer with me: that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed any ſuch words, but with this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, and ſeaſoning of what was ſaid; that my ſtroke was not intended againſt ſuch, whom rude livers call'd Puritanes, as running contrarily to their practiſes: but againſt thoſe that ſhrouding themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious title, caſt a deepe ſcandall upon the true Iſraelites, by the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their owne lives. And I am no changeling, no Chamelion; For, with ſuch I never was, nor ever ſhall be friends. A little farther, I never was the Author, or the Promotor of new inventions. I went alwayes in the ſteps which I found trod before me. Although I was commanded, not to preach in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-no one: yet I never omitted to expound the Catechiſme. I never taxed my Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners above the levell of their ordinary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: I never vexed them with Law-ſuits. More. Although my annuall meanes is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152599:247"/> quickly counted: I never tooke of it, what hath beene taken; nor ever, what was due to me by agreement with me. And why? I am a Shepheard, to feede and preſerve; not a Wolfe, to teare, and devoure. Give me leave. Did the world know, how poore my beginnings were, (I am not aſhamed of them) in what ſmall helpes I have rejoyced; when the Papiſts vaunted, they doubted not to live and ſee me begge mournfully at their dores for a morſell of bread: that my fortunes were carried on the top of the flowing and ebbing waters, two yeares, from banke to banke, before I was fixed: and then, but weakly ſetled in a dark nooke. Did men know, how I have beene uſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, forced, threatned, reviled, diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, they would not be angry that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſubſiſt, and to preach the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt.

                  <p>ANd now, I thanke the Papiſts, for my unconquerable reſolution; growing from the groſſeneſſe of their ſcandals. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> Brethren were very malicious againſt him; they ſold him to ſlavery; the Scene
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:152599:247"/> beganne to bee tragicall. God came to act his part, turned the wheele; and made all this malice, and miſery end in the great benefit; not onely, of the malicious, and undeſerving Brethren; but of <hi>Joſeph</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his old Father, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Egypt. Judas</hi> ſold his Maſter, his Maſter, and the Maſter of all things, for thirty pence; the money would goe but a little way; he had an ill bargaine. When his part was done, God entred upon the Stage, and by the execrable perfidiouſneſſe of the Traitour <hi>Judas,</hi> brought about the redemption of mankinde, the ſalvation of the whole world; and in effect, all the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that is, and ever ſhall be made by glorious ſoules, and bodies in Heaven. I doe not except the ſoule, and body of our Mediatour, and Advocate Chriſt Jeſus: who though he did not redeeme himſelfe; becauſe he was not in captivity; yet came to be betraied, and to redeeme his Betrayer, if he would have bin redeemed. By this law a prudent Mr. of a family, turnes the rough nature of an angry Dog, to the benefit, and peace of himſelfe, and his family; and a wiſe Phyſitian, the eager thirſt of a bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty horſeleach, to the health of a ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; although indeed, theſe unreaſonable creatures of themſelves, aime at nothing,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152599:248"/> but to ſatiate their owne wilde natures. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of evill men, ſaith, <hi>Ne igitur putes, gratis malos eſſe in hoc mundo, &amp; nihil boni ex illis metere Deum; quia omnis malus aut ideo vivit, ut corrigatur; aut ideo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, ut per illum bonus exerceatur:</hi> Doe not therefore thinke, that evill men are ſuffered to be evill in this world, for no good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and that God reapes no benefit by them: For, every evill man, either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lives, that in time he may decline from evill, and incline to good; or therefore lives, that the good man may be exerciſed, and farthered in the practiſe of goodneſſe by him: otherwiſe, he ſhould no live. There is a courſe of things, within the generall courſe of this world, pertaining to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; to which, God brings all ſtraggling chances in the laſt act of the play; which if we did examine, as they come and beget experience, we ſhould enlighten, and enrich the underſtanding with heavenly matters, exceedingly. We behold, how admirably at this day, moved by the ſinfull occaſion of Hereſie and Superſtition, the Church doth watch, and pray: and we know, that a multitude of ſoules, now crowned in Heaven, hath learned to avoid ſinne, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving others puniſhed for ſinne; which could not in juſtice, have beene puniſhed, if
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152599:248"/> it had not beene committed: and how murderes doe open the gate of Heaven for Martyrs: and that the bloud of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs hath beene the ſeed of the Church: for, if they had not died bodily, many had not lived ſpiritually. And to goe as high as may be: Good comes to God, by the worſt of evils; the good of glory by ſinne: For, to ſpeake with <hi>Caſſiodore: Materia eſt gloriae principalis, delinquentis reatus; quia niſi cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parum</hi>

And though I gather good from the evill of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet, the evill of the Church, is to me, a ſound ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the Church.

                  <p>O What a ſweetneſſe of heart it was to me, when I firſt entred into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, after my converſion, to heare the people anſwer, and ſee them liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152599:252"/> in divine Service? O the poore Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people amongſt the Papiſts! who not underſtanding their Service, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hearing Sermons; live more like beaſts, then men: I have ſeene of the Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egos, and heard of ſome Countrey people in <hi>Italy,</hi> who (they confeſſed) did not much differ from beaſts, but in the outward ſhape. And the caſe of all people in <hi>Rome,</hi> is to be lamented; whoſe ordinary phraſe is; Come, let us goe and heare Muſick, and the Cardinals boyes ſing, at ſuch a Church. This is to pleaſe the ſenſe, not God. I ſaw ſuch a repreſentation of Hell and Heaven, in a Cardinals Palace; and the parts of Saints and Devils ſo performed with ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Muſicke; and the ſoules in ſo great a number, comming out of the world, into Purgatory; that it was wonderfull.</p>
                  <p>Shewes of this nature are often ſeene in their Churches. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayes well: <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis cognitio noſtra a ſenſu initium habet;</hi> All the knowledge we gather from below, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the ſenſe. And theſe Scribes and Phariſees, doe foole the ſenſes of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exceedingly.</p>
                  <p>I have an old manuſcript, wrought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently with gold, and painting: In which booke there is a prayer with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: <hi>Oratio venerabilis Bedae Presbyteri
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152599:252"/> de ſeptem verbis Chriſti in eruce pendentis: quam orationem quicunque quotidie devote dixerit, nec Diabolus, nec malus homo ei nocere poterit: nec ſine confeſſione morietur: &amp; per tringinta dies ante obitum ſuum, videbit glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſam Virginem Mariam, in auxilium ſibi praeparatam.</hi> The prayer of venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> Prieſt, of the ſeven words, or ſpeeches of Chriſt, hanging upon the Croſſe: which prayer, whoſoever ſhall ſay devoutly every day upon his knees; neither the Devill, nor any evill man ſhall ever hurt him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall he die without confeſſion; and three hundred dayes before his death, hee ſhall ſee the glorious Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to ſuccour him. At the Buſſe in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>Peter;</hi> they have pictured a Biſhop in a glaſſe-window. On one ſide of him, hangs Chriſt upon the Croſſe, with his wounds bleeding: On the otherſide ſtands the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with her breaſts running. The Biſhop in the middle, is made with a divided countenance; and theſe words are drawne in a long roll, from his mouth: <hi>quo me vertam neſcio,</hi> I know not, to which of theſe two, to turne my ſelfe; either to the bloud of Chriſt, or to the milke of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And was not this an ignorant Biſhop? and was his flock like to thrive?</p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:152599:253"/>
                  <p>They lead their people ſtrangely by the eares alſo: They ſend letters very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Colledges, which are read in the Refectories, and recreations, as their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of newes are; and where in paſſages are farre otherwiſe related, then they were done.</p>
                  <p>When I was a Spaniard, a Prieſt having beene put to death in <hi>England,</hi> there came preſently a relation; that the quarters of the Prieſt, being brought to the Judges houſe, he commanded them to be laid by a hanch or two of Veniſon, (which by chance had beene then preſented to him) and moſt unhumanely compared the one with the other; jeſting, and ſcoffing at them. The Engliſh Jeſuits have beat the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards into ſuch a ſtupidity, by perſwaſion; that they ſcarce either ſee them, or the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, even in the ſtreets; but they run to them, and kiſſe their garments; thinking they will all very ſuddenly be Martyrs. And ſomtimes they runne upon confeſſed ſinnes; that they may pleaſe, and flatter the ſenſes of people. <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> a Painter of <hi>Rome,</hi> having enticed a young man into his houſe, under the ſmooth pretence of drawing a picture by the ſight of him: bound him to a great woodden Croſſe, and having ſtabbed him to the heart with a Pen-knife, in imitation of <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> that had tortured an old captive
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152599:253"/> in the like cauſe; drew Chriſt hanging, and dying upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe, after his reſemblance; &amp; yet eſcaped without puniſhment. And this picture, becauſe it ſets forth Chriſt dying, as if the picture it ſelfe were dying, and with a ſhew of motion in every part; and becauſe it gives the death of Chriſt to the life; is had in great veneration amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>And that their Churches may not want fingers, they take ſomewhat from their children in their cradles; which, if many of their Prieſts did miſſe, they would not be ſo much miſchievous: neither ſhould I, and others, have had ground to ſuſpect the young Engliſh Jeſuits in their Colledges, that are ſo full of ſport, and play with the faireſt amongſt the boyes. One example in a kinde, will ſuffice: it hath beene often in the mouth of an Engliſh Monk; that he hath wrought more converſions of ours to their way, in Tavernes, then ever any of his Order hath done, with all their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances of times, and places. But he more loves Tavernes and Women, then ſoules; or the tongues of his fellow-Monks are not true to him. Surely, this Monk deſerves not to be kneel'd to, when he is firſt ſeene, for a bleſſing: as the Papiſts of <hi>England</hi> are wont to behave themſelves towards their Prieſts. He will give a curſe rather, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152599:254"/> his humble ſuppliants, if men, to the Taverne, if women, to his chamber.</p>
                  <p>It is no hard matter to varniſh over theſe abuſes. Reader be carefull, Arts are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things; they will make new things, change old things, doe all things. If you be not very wiſe, and wary, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, with excuſes, gloſſes, pretences, profeſſions, expreſſions, accuſations. And he that ſuffers himſelfe to be deceiv'd by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is his foole. O how eaſie it is, with a word, a geſture, a countenance, to make men ridiculous!</p>
                  <p>It is not poſſible to write, but many things will lie faire to the ſtroke of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and carping diſpoſition. Their way is known, they joyn their heads, hearts, pains, and pens together. Some Index-men looke into Authors, ſome invent the matter. What pertaines to ſeverall Sciences, is diſtributed to ſeverall Maſters of thoſe Sciences. One diſpoſeth the matter; another cloaths it in language. On my part there are but two; I, and my ſelfe: and one of theſe two, knowes no more then the other. They know me, and the ſecrets of my life: their Authours, and their perſonall faults ſhall eſcape my knowledge. Thus indeed, they ſtand on the higher ground. But, <hi>Chriſtum loquenti linqua nunquam defuit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius;</hi>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:152599:254"/> a tongue was never wanting to Chriſts oratour. And every Chriſtian hath lived in open warre, ever ſince he was chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, with all the Devils in Hell.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                  <p>NOw that I may take my leave manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall turne with an Apoſtrophe to the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, my old friends, pray leave to ſtile your ſelves <hi>Catholiques:</hi> at leaſt for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: If you be <hi>Catholiques,</hi> our great ones, that are very great, and yet more good then great, differing, and diſſenting from you in many, and thoſe waighty points of faith, (as it is confeſſed on both ſides) what are they? you thinke miſchievouſly, but ſpeake if you dare. And what differeth it, to call them (I know the tearme) in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, and to call them ſo by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence? Well, well, goe and leave it. It is too common with you, to blurre, and ſtigmatize whole States; and like the Jtalian, to wound deeply, even when you crouch humbly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, bee not ſo importunate for <hi>Mercie,</hi> before you deſerve it. For, <hi>Mercie</hi> being more neerely allied to goodneſſe then to power, is not ſo much engaged in the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:152599:255"/> illuſtration of power, as in the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Goodneſſe. And Goodneſſe will not be Goodneſſe, if it concurre with <hi>Mercie</hi> in giving way to the propagation of Evill; of Idolatry, and the doctrine of Devils; or in countenancing the profeſſours of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prophaneneſſe. The Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> proclaimeth, that hee was alwayes an enemy to Gods enemies. And <hi>Mercie</hi> hath no proper object, (I meane both divine <hi>Mercie,</hi> and all other <hi>Mercie</hi> regulated by it) but thoſe mournefull conditions, by the repeale of which, either true Innocencie may be reſtored, or Gods holy truth and ſervice advanced; and that, either in the fruit, or in the flower; either in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or in the preparation; or God glorified, not in the by, but directly. God is mercifull to ſinners, (elſe I am in a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe) but upon ſuppoſition of their future amendment; not upon a demand, that they may remaine inwardly, <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> in their former perverſe eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, doe not pretend a ſubmiſſion of heart, except you be heartily ſubmitted. For men will not think, that you, who ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while were generally (I will not ſay ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, but ſtirringly diſpoſed) that it was not eaſie for a ſerious Proteſtant to walke on his way without reproaches, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152599:255"/> affronts from ſome of you; are now grown ſo <hi>humble,</hi> and ſubmiſſive on a ſudden: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they worke, as you doe, by enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and force their underſtandings: to which they are never bound, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith; when they leade them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in <hi>obſequium fidei,</hi> in obedience to Faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, doe not promiſe onely that <hi>to lawes you humbly will ſubmit;</hi> but doe it. For, hitherto you have not. Which I thus make ſtrong by proofe. You have foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and cheriſhed many thouſands of Prieſts in your houſes, (and now doe) in oppoſition to, and in defiance of the firme lawes of this Kingdome: who ceaſe not to trouble the whole State, &amp; Kingdome, and to ſet all on fire, with their ſcandalous and fabulous reports, and with their ſeditious, and libellous Pamphlets: who daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Kings good ſubjects, and draw them by as many devices as the great Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of Hell can hatch or invent, from their duty to God, and allegiance to the King: then which there are no ſtricter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, no ties more ſacred. You promiſe to doe, the contrary of which you moſt wilfully performe, even while the promiſe comes warme from your mouths. Is not this meere juggling?</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:152599:256"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, bee not ſo nominall; doe not call them <hi>Fathers and ſupreame Judges,</hi> and acknowledge their <hi>power to frame or change;</hi> of whom you beleeve otherwiſe then you ſpeake. It is the generall Tenent of your Church (and if you be not as ignorant of your Doctrine, as you are of your Service, you will confeſſe it to be ſo) that Judges; yea, Princes <hi>extra Eccleſiam Catholicam,</hi> out of the Catholike Church, have not power to frame Decrees, or make Lawes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to your Faith. And therefore, your Church ſayes, that your Prieſts are not obliged, or bound by conſcience to give a juſt account to ſuch Judges of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, even thoſe which fall out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; becauſe thoſe Judges have no true, and lawfully-derived power, by which to faſten any ſuch engagement upon them. And it is a received Maxime amongſt your Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, that even a Popiſh Common-wealth, (when the Church and Common-wealth, in ſome ſenſe, are <hi>in eodem gradu atque ordine,</hi> in one and the ſame degree and order of Faith) cannot validly decree any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the glory of the Church, or to the Canons, and conſtitutions of it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, doe not mince your tearmes, (leſt you are ſuſpected in all things) and ſhroud the moſt black attempts, and moſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152599:256"/> bloody practiſes of the Romiſh See againſt our State, with the faire-coloured Mantle of <hi>extraordinary proceedings:</hi> They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary indeed, that is, above all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wayes of wickedneſſe. In truth you are extraordinary in your expreſſions, though not as extraordinary, as your Church in her proceedings. And how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous are thoſe people, that call the top of all miſchiefe but extraordinary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings? I will not ſtraine this point far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſt I learne of the Jeſuits, to break in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Cabinet of ſecrecie which the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cals <hi>ragioni di ſtato.</hi> And heare me, doe not father the Gun-powder treaſon upon a few diſcontented perſons, but lay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er waight of imputation, where the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt waight of ſinne was. O <hi>England,</hi> give me, I pray thee, a reſting place while I live, and when I am dead, a place of buriall. For the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> caſt backe into her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, is nothing but deceit, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. You ſhall finde another leſſon in this booke; and other Authors of that Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of malice and miſchiefe. And whereas a groſſe part of our Engliſh Papiſts are Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited; let the world judge, to what my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads of miſchiefes we lie open.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, do not pleade ſo confidently, that you are in no wiſe guilty of the <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152599:257"/> facts of your Progenitours,</hi> becauſe you are guilty of their Religion, and beliefe: in conformity to which, waighed down with a graine or two of Ghoſtly perſwaſion; they became guilty of thoſe wicked facts. And <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita cauſa, ſequitur effectus,</hi> ſay the Logicians. The cauſe being put, the common cauſe, the Catholike cauſe, the cauſe of Religion; the effect, helped home by the laſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little Ghoſtly inſtruction, may follow. And as you love me, call not your errours, ſuppoſed errours: as if we ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed errours in you, while you are certaine of our errour. I muſt tell you, that wee are as certaine, you erre; as we are certaine, that God and his word erre not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let your truth be ſuppoſed, but not your errours.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, leave the old tricke of cloſing with our Divinity, when it makes for your preſent occaſion, and turne; and againe, forſaking it at every turne. Whatſoever all Divines ſay now, <hi>beliefe was enforced</hi> in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. And ſuppoſe that Beliefe, as being <hi>opus Gratiae,</hi> a worke, or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Grace, is not to be enforced: would you be ſuffered to poſſeſſe your innocent children, ſufficiently Baptized, with a ſtrange beliefe? to encreaſe your number (another would ſay, your peſtiferous and viperous
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:152599:257"/> brood, but I will not) by threats, and promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, and rich rewards? (and thus you enforce beliefe, while you thinke not of it) to win a maine part of our Clergie, though not to your Faith, yet to your occaſions; and by continuall entertainments of them and theirs, make them in many practiſes of high note and conſequence, more yours, then their owne, or ours? eſpecially when your Prieſts are ſtill beſieging your eares, and there whiſpering, that you ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at all times, and by all meanes that are feiceable to ſet up the Popes Throne in all places.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, be not ſo large in the blazoning of your <hi>due obedience:</hi> I will put you a caſe. If your Prince, blowne forward with the zeale of Gods truth, ſhould endeavour to pull the Pope, the grand Father of deluſion and Idolatry, out of his Chaire, in which (men talke) he ſits infallible; and utterly to extirpate ſuch a monſter-power out of the Chriſtian world. Anſwer me: would your Religion permit you to aſſiſt your Prince in that moſt honourable cnterpriſe? And therefore, all your promiſes, I turne over to his examination, <hi>that trieth the heart, and ſearcheth the reines.</hi> Onely, take heed that a mentall reſervation is not at the dore. And if you are ready in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152599:258"/> to miniſter aſſiſtance with your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuns: pray, turn the Channel, and that maſſe of money, which you beſtow on your death-beds to Jeſuits, Monks, Friers, and Prieſts, and to the ſuperabundant mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their houſes in ſtrange lands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the ſafety of your poore Country: which in your liberall contributions to Popiſh uſes, you take paines to ruinate.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for ſhame doe not hope, that your affaires may be ſettled in as great peace, and ſecurity, as theirs; who are united in the ſame reformed Church, with his Majeſty; and not onely, ſerve him faithfully, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, beleeve honourably of his profeſſion, and are one ſoule with him: who ſend not their children by ſtealth into forraine Countries, that ſoiled with ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and a ſtrange Religion in ſtrange Countries, they may returne at length, to teach &amp; diſſeminate in his Dominions, (the peace of which you promiſe with ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in all humility to preſerve) a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion coupled with manners, dangerous to all that he cals his.</p>
                  <p>One thing I dare preſume, that <hi>in this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Jubilee,</hi> it is not intended, that Vice ſhall ſit hand in hand, rejoycing with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; or Errour with truth. And ſo fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. And pray, when we meete againe in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:152599:258"/> this kinde, be true and reall <hi>in omni apice,</hi> in every tittle of what you write. And thinke not, that although I acted the part of a Miniſter, and a Changeling, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and a Turke at Rome; and all in one Comedy of my owne compoſing: you ſhall ever make any more then a jeſt of it, and but a poore one.</p>
                  <p>In our Colledges, they were moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that moſt goared the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> the fond conceit of which, moved mee to turne a Miniſter, by the Alchymy of Action into all ſtrange formes, that I might paſſe more plauſible.</p>

                  <p>HEre I will give certaine formes of Chriſtian duties, which in ſome part belong to me, in regard of my former wandrings: and which I will not fit onely to my ſelfe; that others may uſe them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on emergent occaſions. That God may be glorified; and in conformity to his moſt holy Will, the ſacred meaſure of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152599:259"/> I moſt heartily forgive all people that have treſpaſſed againſt me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoever wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſoever, or howſoever. Now I look better up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, I behold my own ſelf in every one of them; or another me, very like my ſelfe, ſent hither into the world, the ſame way, upon the ſame buſineſſe; and ſweating here in the Vineyard, as I doe, for the ſame or like paiment; (here I doe not meane the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts) and perhaps, pleaſing God better upon earth, by ſome hidden vertues; and to be ſeated more cloſe to him in Heaven, then my ſelfe. Shall I be diſpleaſed with any, with whom, God is pleaſed to be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Indeed, we muſt be friends; for wee hope to live together in one houſe, for ever. And more: I behold the Image of God in them: and our onely Saviour Chriſt Jeſus; in the humane nature, which he tooke, and married to his Divinity; and cleerely in the body which he put upon him. For his ſake, I will imitate Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, becauſe the firſt of Martyrs: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſed with a ſhowre, not of hard words, or the like, but of ſtones: <hi>kneeled downe, and cried with a loud voyce:</hi> His body<note place="margin">Acts. 7. 60.</note> was as low as Earth, but his voice as high as Heaven; and he ſent it thither with a good will; for he cried with a loud voice: and yet, he cried not for the help of others;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:152599:259"/> (helpe, helpe) or for his owne wrongs; but as his wrongs were their ſinnes: and hee kneeled downe, before he was beate down: and although they might have beate him from his ſtanding, yet they could not beate him from his kneeling, before they had beate him from his life; nor with moſt hard ſtones, beate downe his prayer; which then, was his; and now, is mine. <hi>Lord, lay not this ſinne to their charge.</hi> One thing I know: they were, both Gods whips, and the inſtruments of his triall, in reſpect of me: And bleſſed be God in all Eternity, that fitted and prepared to my hands ſo rich, ſo ample, and ſuch fine-weav'd occaſions of patience, and humility. I bleſſe not God for the ſinne, that it was committed; but for his good intention towards me, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the commiſſion of evill, and for the good which he wrought by evill, when it was committed.</p>
                  <p>O the blindneſſe of anger! It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to goe, or ſtand, or ſpet, or ſo much as looke handſomely, in the troubled judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the angry perſon. Anger thinks, that we poyſon the air when we breath, and ſo, is afraid of catching the Plague: and that every thing we looke upon, we infect with the eyes of a Baſiliske: and that what we touch is ſtung by a Scorpion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152599:260"/> the part touched muſt be cut off: and that where wee ſmell, thence we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the ſweetneſſe. And the minde of an angry perſon, ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place<note place="margin">

Where I am deficient by reaſon of diſability, in making the ſatisfaction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, and abſolute in all numbers; I will ſatisfie to the utmoſt limits of my power: and what is wanting, make up, full, and running over, with my prayers. If I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unable; my ſpirituall ſatisfaction ſhall be the more ample. If for an injury in matter of goods, no temporall ſatisfaction be required: my ſatisfaction ſhall have two feete, or two wings; and I will ſatisfie, both for the wrong and the curteſie, with love, prayers, and Chriſtian obſervance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I will be ſingularly carefull to reſtore my ſelfe to God in watching, faſting, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and all that is mine, or placed under my care, and any way ſubordinate to mee, every thing in its proper way: And to make even with my neighbours, whereſoever the leaſt ſhadow, or ſemblance of obligation

                  <p>I? and what am I? a little creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of a weak ſickly body, and a ſoule? and there is all I. A body, not taken out of the ſubſtance of Heaven, leſt I ſhould ſeeme more heavenly then I am; nor out of any ſhining ſtarre, leſt I ſhould take a ſtarre for my heavenly Father; nor from bright fire, leſt I ſhould be too fiery; nor yet from the goodly mines of gold, leſt my minde ſhould be altogether upon gold; nor compacted of precious jewels, leſt I ſhould thinke my ſelfe a precious jewell: but of earth, a dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, filthy, foule thing, that we, and all the beaſts of the field, go upon; and which I wipe carefully every day from my ſhooes. O man of earth, bee not ſo rough, wipe it off gently, remember thy Creation: and part of it, perhaps, was once part of as tall a body as thine owne. And for my ſoule, it was made of nothing: and if God ſhould ſtep aſide, and forſake it, one poſting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of time, it would preſently give backe, and fall to nothing: and nothing can be
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:152599:267"/> ſo vile, as nothing. <hi>Conſervatio,</hi> ſay the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, <hi>eſt continuata generatio,</hi> Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is a continued generation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where the continuance of generation is interrupted, conſervation ceaſeth. The fire in the furnace, did not burne the three children; becauſe God as he is the worker of miracles, aſcending, as it were, above himſelfe, as he is the Author of Nature, denyed the continuance of generation to the power of burning in the fire; and ſo the conſervation of it ceaſing, it periſhed for a time but the three children being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, God quickly remembred that he was the Authour of Nature, and the fire burnt againe. And here was another miracle: For, God having ſuſpended his concourſe, and held it from that part of the fire, where the children walked; doubled it above Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon that part of the fire, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Perſecutors, which now was elevated above the ordinary condition of fire. And thus it is evident, that my ſoule, now ſomething, once nothing, hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the beſt thing, in the worſt manner: upon which, it, and all things hang, both in being and operations; and by which onely, it is the hopefull thing it is: as if ſome good, and mercifull man ſhould hold me up from being ſwallowed into a gulfe,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:152599:267"/> or a deepe Well, and in the meane time I ſhould enrage him with foule words, and ſtab at him. It is part of the firſt maſſage, which God ſent by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the children of <hi>Iſrael, I AM hath ſent me unto you.</hi> He<note place="margin">Exod 3. 14.</note> cals himſelfe, <hi>I AM,</hi> becauſe he onely is <hi>ens per ſe ſubſiſtens,</hi> a thing ſubſiſtent by himſelfe, he is the fountaine of all kindes of being, he onely ſtands without a prop. And <hi>I AM,</hi> is Gods moſt ancient name, becauſe Being is the firſt thing conceiveable in him: And <hi>I AM,</hi> had beſt authority to ſend, becauſe his power cannot be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, or miniſteriall. <hi>I AM,</hi> could not be deputed as a Delegate, to the office of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The quality of the injury, is alwaies proportion'd to the quality of the perſon injured, and alwayes meaſured by it; with reference to the condition of him, who offers the injury.

                  <p>BUt how have I injured God? by ſin: the onely meanes, by which he can be injured. Now, to aske what a kind of thing, ſinne is; is to poſe all kindes of learning. Logick, from which we require the nature of a thing by a definition, confeſſes, that ſhe is altogether ignorant, how to define it. Divinity ſtands amaz'd, and is troubled at the ſight of ſhe knowes not what, breaking within her holy bounds: it is ſo blacke, ſo deformed, ſuch a monſter, as being halfe ſomething, and halfe nothing, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting due parts, not to it ſelfe, but to a good thing; and being imperfect beneath all compariſon. It is no eaſie taske exactly to tell what is darkneſſe, blindneſſe, lameneſſe, ſickneſſe, death. But to tell what ſinne is, is ſo hard, how hard? ſo hard, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done. For, as the worthineſſe of God cannot be ſufficiently expreſſed, for its ſingular prerogative of excellence: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinne, by reaſon of its particular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe. It hath a title, or a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription rather, and that is, <hi>malum infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> It is an infinite evill: becauſe extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to an infinite good. 'Tis a thing, not a thing, which God, who is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and made all things we ever ſaw, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:152599:268"/> a great deale more: and who is able to make more perfect creatures, then we have yet ſeene; yea, then the Angels; cannot with all his heavenly power, be the cauſe of. For, although impotencie, which includeth weakneſſe, may not touch him that is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent; yet, ſome things God cannot doe, either becauſe he followes the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry law, to which he hath obliged himſelfe from all eternity: or becauſe he is tyed by a Decree, or by a promiſe; or becauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath neceſſarily bound himſelfe to himſelfe, to doe nothing contrary to the perfection of his Attributes; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of evill, would be moſt contrary to the perfection of his goodneſſe. <hi>Nam quid,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe, impoſſible eſt Deo? non</hi>

                     </note> Manichees, The evill of ſinne hath no nature: for had it had a nature, God had made it. Sinne is a miſchiefe, ſo
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:152599:269"/> malitiouſly grievous, and ſo grievouſly malitious, that no man, not the greateſt Doctor that ever flouriſhed in the Church of Chriſt: that no Angell, no not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Seraphin of them all, notwithſtanding all their deepe, and ſearching knowledge, ſufficiently ever knew the malice, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſſe of one ſinne. And yet, I deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately commit many ſins, and many ſorts of ſinnes, every day. O good Lord, what doe I, when I ſinne? God onely knowes how venemous a thing, ſinne is. And the reaſon is as plain, as the doctrine is ſtrange: God onely knowes, knowes perfectly, his owne infinite goodneſſe; and therefore, God onely, perfectly knowes all extreme oppoſition to his owne infinite goodneſſe. For, how can we, or any power under God, made, or poſſible to be made, exactly know the nature of a contrary, as contrary, or, that we call the nature of it; when wee cannot fully graſpe the perfection of that, to which the contrary is contrary. But ſinne is only, and wholly contrary to God, and in the firſt place, to his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and that, which is contrary to all an infinite, muſt be infinitely contrary to it. Hence it is not deduced, but runs of it ſelfe: that all Gods Attributes, (of which, every one is all his Eſſence) his Goodneſſe, Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:152599:269"/> Providence, Mercie, Juſtice, Power, Purity, Infinity, Immenſity, Eternity, and all, are exceedingly ſtruck at in every ſinne. Struck at? ſtruck, beaten, buffeted: ſo that no little part, as I may ſay, of the divine Majeſty, is left unwounded, unmaimed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruiſed. And, as all the perfections of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and honour, which are, and are found in creatures, by creatures, as foot-ſteps of the Creatour; are alſo originally, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt perfectly, and therefore, moſt eminently, and infinitely, in God: So (mark this, my ſoule) becauſe ſinne is Gods onely enemy; and becauſe there is a combination of evill, the onely contrary to all kindes of goodneſſe, linked together in themſelves, becauſe joyned together in God: one ſinne containeth, and comprehendeth all kindes of filthineſſe, all kindes of deformity; the filthineſſe and deformity of all other ſins. Which is one of the reaſons, why it is ſaid in Saint <hi>James, Whoſoever ſhall keepe the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> Another cauſe is: The ſinner which breakes charity with God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends him in one point; the way being now open, and the reaſons why he ought not to offend God, violated; is ready of himſelfe, to offend him in another, and in all; and will, if power, or occaſions be not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:152599:270"/> wanting. For, he can never give a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, either taken from ſomething in God, or from ſomething concerning himſelfe, why he ſhould offend God in one point, and not in another; becauſe he can never give a good reaſon, why he ſhould offend him at all: and every offence of God, is moſt contrary to reaſon. Sinne is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evill, or rather all evill; and therefore, ſo contrary to God, the chiefeſt good, or rather, all good: that although it is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe directed to a good end, by his Providence; yet neither can it be ſo much as fathered by his Omnipotence; nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by his Juſtice; nor yet approved by his wiſedome. And is it not a moſt wicked buſineſſe, to commit an act of that ſoule quality; that Gods Providence muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to worke, and turn it to Good, or he lies open to a reproach, for having ſuffered evill: and there muſt be that, which wee name a thing, in the world; and God the Creator of all things, muſt not be the cauſe of it, nor have any hand in it: and God muſt be forced to ſtrike with his juſtice, as if he delighted in our deſtruction: And if he will know all, and be God, he muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to looke upon that which his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot like, becauſe it hath no being in him, as it is the folly of ſinne, nor any
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:152599:270"/> connexion with his wiſdome? I am certain, I thinke not of all this, when I ſinne. Sinne is the deſtruction of Grace. I have ſaid enough. And <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> diſputing<note place="margin">Tho. Aqui. 1. 2. <hi>q. 113. art. 9. ad 2.</hi>

And Grace in the ſoule, may be fitly compared to the light of the Sunne in the world. For as there are degrees and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of this outward light, ſuiting with the time of the day: So, there is the light of Nature, that is, of Reaſon in us: the light of Learning; the light of Experience; the light of Grace. This faire light of the Sunne, the light of Grace, we in the meane time crucifying and killing Chriſt; is all darkened with ſinne: as the Sunne it ſelfe was darkened when Chriſt hung dying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe.

And was not this a ſweet ſhower? were not the teares ſweeter then the oyntment, though the oyntment was paſſing ſweete? Now, my head, and eyes, and lips, and hands, and heart, and all, can yee be lookers on, and not actors, and imitators of what yee ſee? I am not worthy to take in, or give out the ſweete aire of Heaven. What ſaid I? Was it Heaven I ſpoke of? I am not worthy to name Heaven. And yet ſtill I name it, as if I did belong to it.

If I were now againe, to make my firſt entrance upon the yeares of Reaſon, and Diſcretion: I would in the word of a Chriſtian, aided by Chriſt, I would ſtand alwayes like a Watch-man over my ſelfe: I would bee ever awake: I would ſuſpect all occurrences, that could in reaſon be ſuſpected: and have an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every darke place; and upon every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where a Devill can hide himſelfe, or his black head.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:152599:274"/> diſeaſe, which having arreſted (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) one of us, and given him two or three tokens of death, will ſcarce allow him time to looke up to Heaven, and ſay, Lord bee mercifull unto me a ſinner. There whole Countries, miſerably waſted, and unpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by Famine; while men doe walke from place to place like pale Ghoſts, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Anatomies, and feede heartily upon their owne fleſh, paying the debt due to the ſtomach, out of their armes; and while the hungry mother is enforced, as in the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to returne her deareſt child by pieces into the place, from which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gave it entire. Yonder, a great part of the world moſt cruelly devoured by the ſword; where bloud lies ſpilt ſometimes in greater abundance then water; and where is no reſpect had to feeble old age, to weake women, or to innocent children; but all lie mangled in a heape, as if no ſuch thing had beene ever heard of there, as mercie. Sinne is the wicked actor of all this. Here he may behold Fire, turning the labours of an hundred yeeres, in one ſmall houre, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unprofitable aſhes; and perhaps, many a gallant man and woman burnt, &amp; brought almoſt to a handfull. There, Water brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out by maine ſtrength from the Sea, and ſpreading it ſelf over Towns &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:152599:275"/> to the deſtruction of every living thing, but ſuch as God made to thrive in the water: while the loſt carcaſſes of poore Chriſtians are carried in a great number, from ſhore to ſhore, from Country to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, all ſwell'd and torne, till they are waſht away into fruitleſſe ſcum, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth here, and there, on the top of the water, to obey all tides, and to be toſſed, and tumbled with every winde. Invention can aſſigne no other cauſe of all this, but ſinne. All the puniſhments that ever were, are, or ſhall be inflicted upon men: All the evils, which ever did, doe now, or ſhall hereafter fall heavie upon Creatures, be they ſenſible, or unſenſible, appointed for mans uſe, draw life, breath, ſtrength, ſinewes, and all their force from the foule ſinnes, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the world.</p>
                  <p>Pauſe here a little, and give place to a pious meditation. If Almighty God did ſo rigorouſly puniſh thoſe adulterate Cities of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> with <hi>Sodome</hi> the chiefe head of them, that beſides the preſent puniſhment of a ſudden overthrow by fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from Heaven, as if juſtice could not ſtand quiet in ſuch grievous crimes; the Countrey, which once was a ſecond Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, another garden of the world, now at this day, lies ſo pitifully deſolate; that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:152599:275"/> nothing is to be ſeene, but black and ſutty ground, aſhes and ſtones halfe burnt: there remaining in the middle a great Lake, called by a ſcornefull name, <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> the dead Sea: from which a darke ſmoke continually riſes, moſt pernicious to man, and every living creature: where are no trees but ſuch as are hypocritically fruitfull. Apples indeed, hang openly, and which, in the judgement of the eye, are ripe: but come to them, enticed with their colour, &amp; preſſe them with the leaſt touch, they ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſently into vaine duſt.

And becauſe they were ſuch deſerving ſinners, and yet, were not quick in going to Hell; Hell came to them in fire and brimſtone. Five great Cities, and every part of them, were all on fire together: and it burnt ſo violently, that all the Sea could not have quenched the flames. And was not Gods Anger burning
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:152599:276"/> hot? me thinkes now I heare the damned in Hell, cry from all ſides, fire, fire, fire: and yet, no creature will ever be able to quench the leaſt ſparke of it. O the goodneſſe of God, that holds me up, over the great Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons mouth; and yet ſtill out of his mouth, though he does crave, and whine, and cry for me. If I ſay, God Almighty imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an iron inſtrument, theſe horrid markes of his anger, on the hatefull fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of one Countrey, for the ſinnes of ſome few people: what, O what will hee doe, or in what ſtrenge, and new kind of anger, will he expreſſe himſelfe in the black day of judgement, for the ſinnes of the whole world? Eſpecially, ſince that ſinne is now growne exceedingly more diverſe, both in the ſpecies, and in the particulars, then it was in the infancie, or childhood of the world. In the day of judgement, when the Devill queſtionleſſe, as Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, will ſay ſomething before the Bench, to aggravate the matter: Heare, great Lord of Heaven and Hell, I created not theſe people, (nor could I bring them from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) Nor did I engrave my great ſigne and Image in their ſoules. I did not take their nature. I did not ſweat bloud, nor die for them. I did not ſend Apoſtles, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, to ſignifie my will to them, in a moſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:152599:276"/> powerfull manner; or give grace to effect it. I never wrought a miracle to bring waight to my ſayings: Nor did I promiſe them a Kingdome, or eternall bleſſedneſſe: but truely, prepared for them a dark Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where they ſhall lie, and die with me eternally. And yet, behold mighty Judge, my curſed crew of reprobates is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by infinites: whom though I much hate, yet I much love their company.</p>
                  <p>And if we looke before <hi>Sodome;</hi> God in his dreadfull anger, drowned all the world for ſinne; both man and beaſt: behaving himſelfe in regard of mans beaſtly ſins, as if he ſcarce knew, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was the man, and which the beaſt. Had we beene (as we might have beene) in the number of thoſe poore loſt wretches, where had wee beene this day? Diſtreſſed creatures, they climed the trees; they flew to the tops of the mountaines to ſave their lives: Happy was he or ſhe that ſtood higheſt. But all in vaine. The waters roſe by ſome and by ſome, they waiting with trembling expectation: the Floud gat up as high as they: the waves tooke them, roaring as loud as they; and their ſinnes ſunke them. Part of them cleaved to boards, plankes, and other floating move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables for a while: the drunkard to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, the covetous man to his cheſt of mony,

With anger he ſmothereth the gift of knowledge: For, blinded with anger, we judge not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. With envie, he ſtifleth the gift of piety or godlineſſe; For, by envie we ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with our thoughts, words, and actions, againſt our neighbours.

Here is a battell, wherein the weake over-come the ſtrong; and all, becauſe the ſtrong are fallen into the miſchievous hands of a moſt barbarous Traitor, a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to God, and his owne ſoule.

One ſinne is a greater evill, greater above expreſſion, then all the evils of puniſhment, that can be inflicted upon us, by God himſelfe, in this world, or in the world to come: A greater evill beyond all meaſure, then Hell-fire, which ſhall never be quenched. One ſinne. O what have I done many thouſand times over! It is the truth, and nothing but the truth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is ſaid of the ſinne of evill ſpeaking: <hi>The death thereof is an evill death, the grave</hi>

                     <hi>were better then it.</hi> The words will beare another ſenſe, <hi>utilis potius infernus quam illa,</hi> Hell were more profitable then it. And this is proved as eaſily as written, or ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, the evils of puniſhment bereave us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of limited and finite goods: as ſickneſſe depriveth us of health, death of life. But ſinne depriveth us of God, the onely Good that is infinite. And the privation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by ſo much the more grievous, by how much the good is more good, of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:152599:280"/> which we are deprived. The evils of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come from God, flow naturally from him, as from their true ſource &amp; cauſe. Go, aske the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> he will ſay as much:<note place="margin">Amos 3. 6</note> 
                     <hi>Shall there be evill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> God hath nothing to doe with ſinne, but foure wayes: in all which he ſtands off, and comes not neere it: In the hindrance, in the ſufferance, in turning it to good ends, and in appointing the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And all the evils of puniſhment, which God ever heaped upon man, on earth, and in Hell, or is able to heape, are not fit puniſhment; my drift is not equall to the miſchiefe of one ſinne, though the Papiſts thinke otherwiſe of their veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes: God alwayes puniſhing under the deſert of ſinne, as he alwayes rewards above vertue; as being more prone to the acts of mercie, then of juſtice. And neither all Gods Creatures, nor God himſelfe (be it ſpoken with due reverence and reſpect to his omnipotencie) can ſhower downe ſo great evils upon man, as he daily pulleth upon himſelfe. For they can onely ſting his body with the evils of puniſhment; he ſtaineth his owne ſoule with the evill of ſin. And therefore Saint <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Paradox, out of which he hath dreined a moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Homily, is not a Paradox: <hi>Nemo laedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:152599:281"/> niſi a ſeipſo.</hi> No man is hurt but by himſelfe: For, it is plaine, that matters of puniſhment may be turned to vertue, which doth not hurt: but alwayes from ſinne comes dammage and hurt, becauſe more is loſt then gain'd, though all the world bee gain'd: it being ſure, that by ſinne God is loſt, and cannot be gain'd. Sinne, (to ſpeak gently) is the ſleepe of the ſoule. For, as he that ſleepeth, feares oftentimes what is not to be feared: As, to be drowned in deepe waters, to fall from the top of a high rock into the Sea, to be devoured by a Beare, or a Lion, or ſome ſuch vaine thing, of which he dreames; but the Thiefe, who comes now in earneſt to cut his throat, he feares not: So the ſinner feares ſome few ſhadowes of danger, but not the ſinne that kils him. O fooliſh Horſe, that ſtarts at the ſhadow of a tree, and when the Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſound, runs gladly among the Pikes, thruſting himſelfe upon true danger! And as he that ſleepeth, beleeves oftentimes, that he is in full poſſeſſion of that which hee hath not. He dreames of gold, and of a Palace; and in the act, the cobwebs of his poore Cottage drop upon his face, and wake him. The ſinner being in danger, dreames of ſafety; and wakes, environed with danger. And laſtly, as he that ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:152599:281"/> performes oftentimes the worke of a waking man, but imperfectly: He ſpeakes, but brokenly, and with little ſenſe: He ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and walkes, but ſeldome without a fall. So the habits of vertues being deſtroyed in a ſinner, have left a warmth and facility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them; which ſeeme vertuous, when they are not; and therefore delude excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, both the perſon and all the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his carriage.

                     </gap>, a director, not onely of his words, but of his deeds alſo. But he that is warmed with ſuch a heate, when the fire is gone, beleeves that he is hot, rejoyceth in it; and little thinkes what kinde of warmth it is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is heated.</p>
                  <p>From theſe premiſes, I gather what I had loſt. I had loſt the princely robe of juſtice, the rich garment of needle-worke, wherewith the Kings daughter was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: after the loſſe of which, my ſoule was
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:152599:282"/> not the Kings daughter. I had loſt the name, dignity, and credit of Gods good childe: the ſpeciall providence, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with which he ſhrouds, as a Hen her Chickens, covers, and ſpreads himſelfe over the juſt: (O tis warme being under his wings) and all the more ſpeciall helpes, which imparting to them, he denies to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I had loſt. I had loſt faith, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hope, all infuſed vertues: which are the ſtrength, veines, and ſinewes of the ſoule, by which ſhe is enabled to doe well and orderly in order to ſalvation; and which are, as it were, the faire pearles, with which ſhe is beautified. I had loſt, O I had loſt the moſt unvaluable benefit of Chriſts merits. Chriſt could not ſay then to his Father of me; Father give him me, I have bought him. I had loſt God, and therefore was robbed of all good. He that is every where, was gone from me. He was out of my reach, out of my call: and hee would not heare me, but called by earneſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: a hard taske, and not poſſibly to bee compaſſed, without his powerfull aſſiſtance, that was farre from me. And (which is the top of admiration) I had loſt my ſelfe; and could by no meanes, learne whither I was gone. Had I gone out into the ſtreets, and asked all paſſengers, if any good man
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152599:282"/> or woman could tell where I was: Had I ſaid, neighbour, pray have you found me? I am loſt. Whatſoever my neighbours had ſaid, all ſound Chriſtians would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that I was loſt, and ſo loſt, that I could never be found, but by an infinite power: and that for their parts they knew not where I was. Indeed, I neither know, nor ſhall ever know fully, what I had loſt. Go now, all Merchants, and Tradeſmen, henceforth hold your peace, ſpeak no more of your loſſes by Sea or Land. I had loſt more, then Land and Sea themſelves. And having loſt all good, I ſtaid not there, but alſo was over-whelmed with all evill. It is a great evill of diſgrace to be the childe of a wicked man, or willing to ſerve him. Sin had made me the childe of the Devill, and more ſubject then a childe, a ſlave to him and ſinne. And therefore Chriſt ſaid to ſinners, <hi>Yee are of your Father the Devill.</hi> He ſaid likewiſe, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, whoſoever committeth ſinne, is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of ſinne.</hi> Sin then, being all over evill, and all the evill that is: and I having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſinne, and ſo, being the willing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of ſinne, what a ſtrange kinde of evill was I, that ſerved ſo great an evill; when we all know, the ſervant is not higher then his Maſter, but much under him? Here is a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:152599:283"/> ſecret. It is an evill chance to a houſe, when it fals into the moſt hard hands of a cruell murderer, or bloody traitor. But ſin had changed me into the moſt unhappy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Devill. And I that once feared to ſee the Devill, and who if I had ſeene him, would have runne; much more, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to come neare him, or to dwell with him in the ſame houſe, or chamber; had then tooke both him, and Hell-fire that he carries about him, into my owne ſelfe, and given him the cloſet of my owne heart to lodge in. Sinne changed the Angels of Heaven from a pure white, to a moſt foule blacke. And thus it had altered me. I know that ſome of Gods people, had they ſeene me, would have ſaid: What ere the matter is, you are wonderfully changed: And then, I might well have anſwered, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am not well, I am vexed with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall fit of a deadly ſickneſſe. And I am ſo weakened by it, that I cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt good and bad. I have exchanged God for vile things, hypocriſie and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, which I have preferred before God. For he that of two things laid before him, chuſeth one, eſteemes that to be the greater good which he taketh, and preferreth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other. I know not what I doe: For I wound God altogether with his own
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:152599:283"/> weapons, with the ſame gifts, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, with a condition to ſerve him: having turned all his gifts into the ſharp weapons of ſinne. I wound him with his owne concurſe, his power, by which he doth aſſiſt me in all actions, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my nature; ſo that I force God to ſtrike himſelfe in very deed with his owne hand, as if I dealt with a childe: and ſet God againſt himſelfe, as it were, cauſing diviſion in the beſt, and higheſt unity.</p>
                  <p>But now being recovered of the diſeaſe, my underſtanding is more cleare, and more diſcerning; and knowing God here, my Faith and Hope give me a kinde of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I ſhall know him more diſtinctly hereafter, and ſee him <hi>face to face.</hi> Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to know, labours to know; and becauſe knowledge is honey-ſweete, the more he knowes, the more he labours to know, and the more he knowes to labour for knowledge. And in his labouring to know, one chiefe part of the knowledge he gaines, is, that although he ſtill labours to know, and ſtill knowes, and although hee ſhould live a thouſand yeeres, and ſtill know; ſtill amongſt the things which may be knowne, they would be more which he knowes not, then which he knowes. And ſo ſtill it would be, though he ſhould live
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:152599:284"/> in the world, for ever. But God did not plant the naturall paſſion of deſire in the reaſonable ſoule, with an intention, that it ſhould alwayes lie gaping; but that it ſhould at length be ſatisfied, when it ſhould cloſe at laſt, with its laſt end. The like effect followes in purſuing other objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. If God ſhould have made, after his conqueſt of one, another world for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> when he had done there, he would have beene weeping againe: while indeed, hee would not have wept for another world, but implicitely for God, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>could have filled his boundleſſe deſire. The deſire of man, is in a manner infinite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it deſires one thing after another, into infinite: And it can never be ſatisfied in this manner, becauſe the things deſired come not altogether, but ever, one after another: as the day commeth, but ſucceſſively, houre after houre, not altogether. And therfore it muſt follow, &amp; it will follow, and it cannot but follow, that it muſt be ſatisfied with a thing actually infinite; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhal alwaies feed, and yet alwayes fill the ſoule with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, riches, pleaſure, every good thing: <hi>ut ſemper quidem Deus doceat,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, homo autem ſemper diſcat quae ſunt a Deo:</hi> That God may alwayes teach, and man may always learn: every degree of light opening
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152599:284"/> to the ſoule a more ample and more cleare ſight of God, in himſelfe, or in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Deſire and Love tend to union: we deſire to have, and we love to enjoy. And therefore, the powers deſiring and loving, ſtrive to bring home the thing beloved: where deſire ceaſes, and love remaines. And thus alſo, in the acts of knowledge. For alhough after our manner of knowing in this world, becauſe our knowledge is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, it is not required, that the thing knowne or underſtood ſhould be joyned to the underſtanding, by which we know; but this is contented with a ſpecies or picture of it: yet when we know and ſee clearely, God and the underſtanding come <hi>face to face;</hi> they meete in a cloſe union together. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being the firſt faculty, muſt, as it were, firſt touch the divine Eſſence. I muſt not here imagine, that the union of the bleſſed ſoule with God, is like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Chriſts humanity with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, whence reſulteth one perſon, which we call Chriſt: but ſhe ſhall be joyned to him, as a child to the mothers breſt, where indeed it ſucks, and takes hold with the mouth, but the mother holds it faſt in her armes, ſupporting it, that it cannot fall, either to the ground, or from the breſt. And whereas theſe two faces are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152599:285"/> the Underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be it Angelicall, or Humane, and the Eſſence of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot ſtoop in his Eſſence, though he doth in his power and other Attributes, the created underſtanding, as being very low, is lifted up to the divine Eſſence; that is, ſtrengthened with a light, which we call the light of glory. And this is a true Comment upon the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, In thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> It was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently<note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 9.</note> done of the Father of lights, in the creation of the world, in the firſt place to produce light. For, as it was the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature, ſo it ſhall be the laſt, I meane, the light of glory. He begins with light, he goes on with light; look elſe: and he ends with light. And why ſo? becauſe God is light, and becauſe he ever was, and is, and ever wil be light. The ſoule ſhall ſee in God, a moſt exact Unity branched into a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; a moſt perfect Trinity gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an Unity: the moſt excellent indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, or rather priority of the Father, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither doth the Son or holy Ghoſt in any proper ſenſe, depend) the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent generation of the Son, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is not the other, and yet, they are not three moſt excellent, but one moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. O Myſtery of Myſteries! How the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152599:285"/> Angels in every degree depend upon God, and differ one from another! How becauſe he could not make a creature as perfect as himſelfe, he goes in ſome kinde, as farre as he can, gives them as much of him as he is able: imparting to them unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe and eternity, though not from everlaſting, yet for ever and ever! How fitly the choſen of God, fill up the number of the fallen Angels; every one enjoying a different degree of bleſſedneſſe; their workes, and meanes of their ſalvation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene different: and becauſe of every one it might be ſaid, <hi>Non erat ſimilis illi, qui conſervaret legem Excelſi.</hi> Hee had not his like, in keeping the law of the moſt High: becauſe nature differing in all, the meanes and courſes did anſwerably differ. And whereas in the world, ſhe ſaw God in his creatures, ſhe ſhall now ſee the creatures in God, which ſhe ſaw, which ſhe ſaw not, and which humane eye never ſaw: which ſhall afford her ſatisfaction, though not perfect her bleſſedneſſe, according to S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, He that ſees thee, O God, and thy workes in thee, non propter illa beatior, ſed propter te ſolum,</hi> is not more happy for ſeeing them in thee, but for ſeeing thee onely. She ſhall ſee as much as God hath ſet apart for her bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and though ſhe differ from others
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152599:286"/> in her extenſion of ſight, ſhe ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſhare equally with them, becauſe it is one of her perfections, and indeed part of her bleſſedneſſe, to reſt perfectly upon the will of God, from whence flowes a bleſſed peace. From this beatificall viſion, or ſight of Gods face, ſhall flame out a moſt ardent love of God. Wee behold in the world but certaine emblems of Gods mercie, juſtice, power, and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are out of God, and in creatures; and yet, the reflection ſets us on fire with the love of God. How then ſhall we burne in love towards him, when we ſhall ſee all we ſee, in God, though not all in God, in whom all is God? Verily, this love will have a Property above all loves. For the lover of God in Heaven, cannot but love him. For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having once ſeene him, he cannot but look upon him; and looking upon him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but love him. Many objects in this meane world, meane, in reſpect of Heaven, at the firſt ſight, ſtirre us to love. Looking we love, and loving we looke and the more we look, the more we love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the more we love, the more we looke; and we cannot tell for the time, whether we looke more, or love more. Call away the ſoule that lookes upon God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offer her a thouſand worlds for the preſent, and ten thouſand
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152599:286"/> hereafter. Bring all the cunning entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the Devill can thinke of, or that God can give him leave to forge: make here an aſſurance of all that God can give, beſides himſelfe: bring Gods owne hand to it. Go to her againe, ſpeak aloud, tell her of another Heaven, where, although God is not to be enjoyed, yet there are Angels to be ſeene, and delights without number, to miniſter pleaſures that cannot be numbred. Speake words as faire, as the ſoule you ſpeake to: And cry with the Devill, <hi>All</hi>

                     <hi>theſe things will I give thee:</hi> not over one world, O poore, O barren temptation! but over as many worlds, as God can make, if thou wilt turne aſide from God, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a very little, or winke out but one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She will not, ſhe cannot: not that ſhe will not, becauſe ſhe cannot; or that ſhe cannot, becauſe ſhe will not: but ſhee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will, nor can. Nothing but Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will can move her to turn aſide, or wink, and that ſhee knowes, is conſtant to her Happineſſe. O the baſeneſſe of this world! O the beaſtlineſſe of our luſts, and carnall deſires! O the vileneſſe of our pride, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy bravery! How foule, how ſorbid, how beggerly they are, ſet in compariſon with the fight of God in Heaven? What poore things are they, to take in exchange for
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152599:287"/> eternall bleſſedneſſe? Go, go preſently, and ſell your part of Heaven, your part in God for theſe baſe things. O the vanities of earthly Courts and kingdomes! Give us God, him, him, only him, and let all go. For in God, we ſhall have riches without care, honour without feare, beauty without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, joy without ſorrow, content without vexation; all good things, not one after one, but altogether; and without the defects annexed to them in this imperfect world. The Husband that loves the Wife of his boſome: the Mother that loves the child of her wombe: the children that love their Parents, whoſe living Images they are: the friend, that loves his friend, for whom he would endanger his life, though he hath but one: they may frame a conceit of the tender love of God to the ſoule, and of the ſoule to God: but they cannot entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and comprehenſively conceive it. For upon earth we may love one man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man moſt; yet we may love others, though not as the perſons we love moſt; and our love of others, may have no reſpect to the perſon we love moſt, and ſo our love may bee divided. We cannot love two moſt: <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:152599:287"/> the force it can make, upon God; where onely one is to bee loved: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſaith Saint <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> for Gods moſt perfect unity requires the perfection of a Monarchy. It is the moſt perfect government, where is one ſupreme, Governour, and therefore one God. And though in Heaven, we love Saints, and Angels, yet that love is a naturall branch of the love of God. We love them, becauſe we love God: we love them in God; wee love God in them, we love God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and we love them altogether for God. But where a Trinity of perſons is the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in the higheſt gift of all, and the end of all other gifts, there muſt appeare a trinity of gifts: the ſight of God, the love of God, and a rejoycing in God. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good we receive, and the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of its connexion with us, ſo natur'd is our joy. It muſt then be the greateſt joy, when we ſhall perfectly enjoy the greateſt good. But what if the greateſt good be all good, ſhall we have all joy? yes, I write it with great joy, all joy: the ſight of all, all love, all joy: not that can be given, or that can bee received, but that we can receive. <hi>Quicquid recipitur, ad modum recipientis recipitur:</hi> whatſoever is received, is received according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:152599:288"/> of the receiver. And though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome one or ſome few, ſhall receive all that can be given to ſuch a creature: (for, God now gives himſelfe out moſt freely) yet they ſhall not receive all, becauſe no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite can receive an infinite: nor all that a more perfect creature could receive. It will be no ſmall part of the ſoules joy, that Gods will is done in his Saints, in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in the ſaved, in the damned. <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>

And will it not afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great comfort to the ſoule, to ſee in God, the dangers of this world, both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall, which ſtrengthened with a hand from Heaven, ſhe fairely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? When ſhe thinkes, being now in full ſecurity: With ſuch a plot the Devill aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me at ſuch a time; had not God beene in the combate with me on my ſide, I had beene loſt. Had I runne ſuch a courſe, that runne in my head at ſuch an houre, I had runne head-long to Hell. Had God call'd for me, and for an account, at ſuch a day, by land; by ſea, when the ſea roard, the winds blew, the rocks watcht for the veſſell I was in; when the Ship reeld to and fro like a drunken man, the Sea-men ſtaggered and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:152599:288"/> trembled; I had not beene a bleſſed ſoule. Through what a ſtrange world did I travell hither? how every ſmall corner was beſet with ſnares? how the wayes abroad; how the houſes and ſtreets of Townes; and the very Churches were throng'd with evill Spirits, which I never ſaw till now? How ſweete, how mercifull God was to the world; divided and diſtracted with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errours; defiled with ſo many ſinnes? How could he ſuffer men to live out halfe their dayes? He that brought the world from nothing to ſomething, why did hee not throw it away in his anger, from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to nothing againe O ſweetnſſe, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mercie, great, exceeding, infinite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there ſhe dives. In this life, no joy goes without a ſorrow, without its Keeper: that our life is like the roofe of the great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which, as <hi>Villalpandus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſhewed flowers growing among guilded prickles: and ſurely, in the beſt day of our lives, when wee ſung the ſweeteſt, if wee ſinke into the matter, we ſhall finde, that we had a ſharpe thorne at our breſts. But the inſide of Heaven is without a cloud. Every day, though new, and freſh, and ſhining, is like a Friers weed, diſhonoured with a patch, a badge of our beggery, our miſery.</p>

                     <hi>BY night on my bed,</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoule loveth, I ſought him, but I found him not.</hi> It is very ſtrange. For, that which the Divines call <hi>Gratia prima,</hi> the firſt Grace, comes alwaies by night. It being alwayes darke night, and indeed, the dead of night, before Grace comes. And the firſt Grace doth not finde Grace where it comes: For then, it would not be the firſt. But, the meaning is: the Spouſe before ſhe was the Spouſe, or the ſoule ſought God without Grace, as the Philoſophers, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ſought him without him, as the Giver of ſupernaturall Graces; ſought him by night, ſought light in darkneſſe; rejected the ſufficiencie of Grace offered to her, and thought to doe miracles, and worke above nature, by the helpe of nature. Or if it be a harſh note, ſhe ſought God without Grace: We may ſay, that ſhe was moved by the firſt Grace to ſeeke God: but becauſe ſhe did not worke with it, as farre as the Grace did enable her; ſhe wanted the ſecond Grace, and did not ſeeke him aright. For, ſhee ſought him on her bed, ſluggiſhly, &amp; drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily: She ſought him onely in a dreame:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:152599:290"/> ſhe ſought him, when the belly was full, and the bones at reſt, betwixt ſleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: and therefore, by her leave, ſhe was miſtaken, her ſoule did not love him; For, if her ſoule had loved him, her ſoule would have tooke another order with her body, and ſhe would have ſought him otherwiſe, and might have found him; But now, ſhe ſought him, and ſhe found him not: and why? She was miſtaken both in the time, and in the place. For, he was neither to be found by night, in the darkneſſe of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life; nor on her bed: what ſhould he have done there? hee neither ſlumbreth, nor ſleepeth. She ſhould have ſought him where he was, and would be found. Nor can it in reaſon be imagined, that he would come to her, come to be found, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſhe neither move hand, nor foote, nor eye in the ſearch of him, but lie all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, with her hands and feete ſpread abroad upon a bed of doune, and with her eyes ſhut: and that ſhould paſſe for a ſufficient ſeeking of all goodneſſe; to be rewarded with Heaven. But, though ſhe hath not found him, ſhe hath found her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and ſhe begins againe. <hi>I will riſe now, and goe about the Citie, in the ſtreets, and in the broad wayes, I will ſeeke him whom my ſoule loveth: I ſought him, but I

The firſt beginning of good to be done on our parts, after the kinde entertainment of the inſpiration, is the purpoſe of doing it. Well. She is dreſſing her ſelf haſtily. But what will ſhe doe when ſhe is up? We ſhall quickly ſee. For, I heard her ſay, <hi>I will riſe now;</hi> She will admit of no delay: ſhe will fall to worke, while the inſpiration is warme, and before it cooles. But what doth ſhee meane to doe? Goe to the City. Hitherto ſhe goes well. For, the Wiſe-men, that came to ſeeke Chriſt, wiſely addreſſed themſelves to the City, and there enquired for him. And to declare, that they tooke a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, and that extraordinary helpe is ordained to ſupply the defect of Gods ordinary aſſiſtance: extraordinary meanes failed them; for the new-created ſtarre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. In the City, ſhe will finde many good people, that will gladly tell her good tidings of him, whom her ſoule loveth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſoules have loved him, from their childhood; and ever ſince they knew what it was to love. God gives her a will, and power to riſe. And becauſe ſhee riſes with him, he goes with her to the City. Her going with him, moves him againe, to goe with her. But it is not well, that ſhee will goe about the City. For, if ſhe goe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:152599:291"/> not ſtrait forward, but about the City; ſhe cannot avoid diſtraction, nor multiplicity of buſineſſe: and the Bridegroome will either be neglected, or not worthily regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And ſo it fell out. For, ſhe went about the City in the ſtreets, where ſhee met all ſorts of idle company; a rabble of Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkers; and ſome, with whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, not of Saints, but of ſinnes, had made her acquainted. And now, ſhee was full of buſineſſe: and he, whom (ſhe ſayes) her ſoule loveth, was forgot. And ſhee ſought him in the broad way. The way to Hell, and perdition, is a broad way. Shee ſought the King of Heaven, in the way to Hell. And therefore ſhee found him not. And yet ſhe was very forward in the firſt onſet: <hi>I will riſe now.</hi> She had not made her own, the two leſſons, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are ever coupled together: <hi>Depart from evill, and doe good.</hi> But<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 14. Verſ. 3.</note> what hapned? <hi>The Watchmen that goe about the Citie found me: to whom I ſaid, Saw yee him whom my ſoule loveth?</hi> Is it ſo, pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one? you that roſe up now, and thought to watch out the night, are you took your ſelfe by the Kings Watchmen, for a ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler? for a haunter of the ſtreets, and the broad wayes? It will be queſtion'd now, whether you be honeſt or no, both of your body, and your hands? The watchmen
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:152599:291"/> will tell you, having met you at ſuch a time, that you doe not look honeſtly; that your ſin is plainly written in your forehead. This affliction, I hope, will ſift, and winnow you. You cannot bring the Watchmen within the circle of your fault. It is their office, to go about the City, and to ſurpize ſuch as you are. Reſolve them now, and with ſound reaſon, whence you came, and whither you would. The poore loſt thing hath griefe enough: and her afflictions have made her bold. She will not be queſtion'd. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Watchmen can open their mouths, and ſpeake to her, ſhe is wondrous buſie in the examination of them, <hi>Saw yee him whom my ſoule loveth?</hi> And now, ſhe makes it plaine, that her ſoule loves him. She goes the right way to finde him. She ſues for direction to her beloveds Watchmen. Doe yee heare, you Watchmen, nay, pray let me ſpeake firſt; my late wandring is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable: I goe in queſt of him, whom my ſoule loveth; and my love cannot ſleepe. Speake one of you. Did yee ſee him whom my ſoule loveth? Were my love towards him, all tongue, or all face, I could forbeare his company. But becauſe it is he, whom my ſoule loveth; while I have a ſoule, I cannot be without him. But did yee ſee him? I am in great haſte, pray tell me.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:152599:292"/> While the Watchmen were getting up out of the deepe amazement, into which ſhee had ſtruck them, like an unwonted appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition by night: She ſteps aſide in a heate. And ſo I come to the reſt, I would ſing to my ſoule. <hi>It was but a little that I paſſed from them, but I found him whom my ſoule loveth: I held him, and would not let him goe.</hi> As ſoone as ever I had paſſed beyond them: preſently after I had untwiſted my ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of company. And what then? Let all the world heare, and rejoyce with me. I found whom my ſoule loveth. O deare Lord, have I found thee? Where haſt thou beene this many a day? I have beene ſeeking thee by night, and upon my bed, and about the City, and in the ſtreetes, and in the broad wayes, and I could not finde thee. And I have beene found my ſelfe, and tooke by thy officers, (they are not farre hence) and had not my tongue beene very quick and ready; and my wit good; and my cauſe better; I had beene ſent to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and laid faſt enough. But I preſently tooke them off from all their authority, and us'd thy name, and ſaid, <hi>Saw yee him whom my ſoule loveth?</hi> But, thou haſt not yet told me, where thou haſt beene. Indeed, I was halfe afraid, I had quite loſt thee. I beleeve, I doe, I doe; that, had'ſt not thou
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:152599:292"/> ſought me, more then I ſought thee, wee had never met againe. And thou didſt help me to ſeeke thee: but I could not helpe thee to ſeeke me; as I could not helpe thee to make me. For, I was loſt my ſelfe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my ſelfe, but alſo in my underſtanding: and I knew not, what directions to give for the finding of my ſelfe, becauſe I knew not where I was. But ſince I have extracted from particulars, by the Chymiſtry of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; what a bottomleſſe miſery it is to be loſt from thee: and what a ſolitary labour it is to ſeeke thee; now I have found thee, I will hold thee with my heart, and with both my hands and armes; and I will not let thee goe. The ſoule being now cloſe in the armes of her Beloved, muſt exerciſe her ſpirituall acts in a more perfect manner. Let me kiſſe that middle wound, that hath foure leſſer wounds to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: O thoſe bleſſed Quires of Angels! they ſing marvellouſly well.

For by the courſe of nature, hee is neare death. Who ſeemes to be farre off? the young man: but God can reach him with his bow. Lord helpe us. We are farre gone. We cannot learne that which God taught from the beginning of the world: And when people began to multiply, taught every day, and houre: And that which he moſt teaches of all that ever hee taught. And what is it? that <hi>here we have no continuing City, but ſeeke one to come.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 14</note> Could we ſinfull creatures fore ſee our own ends, and the lamentable chances, that lie watching for us, as we paſſe by ſuch a day, and ſuch an houre; the hardeſt of us would weepe: let us weepe then, for the cauſe of all our miſery, our execrable ſinnes. Chriſt wept over Jeruſalem, becauſe he ſaw the hearts, and fore-ſaw the ends of all the people in the City. He ſaw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps one, ſtretched out with pride, that ſhould, after two months, die like a Dog in a ditch. He ſaw another pawning his very ſoule for honour, that ſhould not live out the fourth part of a yeare to enjoy it. What ſilly fooles the Devill makes us?

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:152599:294"/> and ſcraping for mony, that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould be call'd to a ſtrict account, and caſt into Hell, within the ſhort ſpace of a month. There another, cheering up &amp; pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering his fleſh with dainties, and ſtill the tother cup, that the wormes were within leſſe then ſeven dayes, to enter upon. Here he heard one ſwearing and tearing God, the holy name of God: and there preſently, he heard God alſo <hi>ſwearing, in his wrath, that he ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> And here another, venting as many lies as ſentences; while he heard God ſay, cut him off, let him ſpeake no more: it is my courſe: for the longer he lives, he will be the more wicked. He might ſee two goe reeling in their drunkenneſſe; one of whom the ſame night, ſhould break his necke from a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and the other be ſtab'd to death in a riot. Two more following the vile mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their owne filthy luſts, and in league with baſe women, that the ſame weeke ſhould cut their purſes, and throats together. He ſaw the greateſt part of them, purſuing earneſtly their owne ſinfull deſires, and either diſeaſes gathering to a head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in their bodies; or Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments outwardly muſtering their forces to ſend them to Hell out of hand. Theſe mournefull paſſages Chriſt ſaw, and being

He pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the ſentence of deſtruction againſt the City, and he weepes while he does it. <hi>Hinc illae lacrymae,</hi> Hence came thoſe teares. He wept not, put on with the thought of his owne paſſion, though very nigh, but of their deſtruction. And therefore he ſayes, <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem, weepe not for mee,</hi> for whom then, Lord? <hi>but weepe for your ſelves, and for your children.</hi> Doe we love our children, our pretty little Babes? let us weep for our ſins, that we may not weepe for them. And can we ſee Chriſt weep him that died for us weep, and not offer our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to wipe the teares from his eyes?

And thus we may cry of the ſoules in Hell; of ſome of our friends, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that died lately: O our joy, our quiet, and their miſerable torments! which we ought not to pity, which God pities not. When I have wrote all I can write, I feare, all will end here. There is a bleſſed repoſe in God for good men, and a curſed priſon for wicked livers. But we are ſo buſie in the world betwixt both, that we have no time to thinke of either, to looke upwards
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:152599:295"/> or downewards. Yet know, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay betwixt both forever. We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely appointed for one, where we muſt reſide for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Good Reader, ſtand firme againſt the Devill, and againſt his two Factours, the Fleſh, and the World. Beware, you that thinke your ſelves to be morall men and women, of little ſinnes. Of ſinnes, little in our weake eſtimation, becauſe they canker not our credits, nor caſt upon us the ſtaine of wicked livers. Doe wee give to our endeavours in their commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a command to pleaſe God or men? Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes like himſelfe: <hi>Noli quotidiana peccata contemnere, quia minima ſunt; ſed time, quia plura ſunt: Plerunque minimae beſtiae, ſi multae ſint, necant:</hi> Doe not contemne thy daily ſinnes, becauſe they are ſmall; but feare them, becauſe they are many. Small beaſts, if they bee many, many times kill. And the ſmalleſt ſinne that can be committed, but once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, troubles exceedingly, and offends the moſt cleane cleare eyes of God. If you are ſtill obſtinate, the Devill is more good then you, the blacke Devill of Hell. For Grace is not offered to him, and therefore, he cannot lay hold upon it. It is offered to you with entreaties, and you refuſe it. And
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:152599:295"/> moreover, the Devill is confirmed in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie, you are not. God invites you, I am ſure of it, I am ſure I came from him. The Angels and Saints from Heaven; all the choſen of God from all parts of the world, pray you; as very deſirous of your company. The holy Church entreats you: for I came likewiſe from her, to you. Liſſen to your thoughts, marke there: your own poore ſoules beſeech you, trembling like the Hart ſhot neare the heart, and ſtrucke with the fear of eternall damnation: crying to you, we were made for God. O put us into his hands. Our hearts are very ſicke of a very dangerous diſeaſe, worſe then the Plague, chilneſſe in Gods ſervice. Let us write upon the dore in red letters, as they doe upon the dores of houſes infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Plague; the pen being dipt in the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Lord, have mercie upon us.</hi> Yes, yes, have mercie upon us: and not for our ſakes, not for our Fathers ſakes, not for our Anceſtors ſakes, not for the Saints and Angels ſakes, not for the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> ſake, but for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his ſake.</p>

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:152599:297"/> it appeares, that you ſtand in the ranke of the evill ones: And that you are <hi>my old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,</hi> in the ſame conſtruction, as the World is old, of which one ſayes: <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, qui ob antiquitatem ſapere deberet, &amp;c.</hi> The World, which becauſe it is ſo old, ought to be wiſe, growes every day more unwiſe, as it is more old.</p>
                        <p>A hand I have received, and a good one, but that as good a heart came with it, will not ſinke into my heart. The hand is faire; but how ſhall I know the heart is not foule? Indeed, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayes, that ſpeech is the picture, or image of the minde. But hee meanes, when the ſpeech is the mindes true Interpreter. You cannot be ignorant, that it is a received, though a cloſe principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jeſuits, <hi>We may be free of faire words: becauſe they goe not from us, as drops of bloud, or money with loſſe, or expence.</hi> O the riches of experience!

But I am glewed to my Superiours, by the firme tyes of extraordinary love and ſubjection, and therefore, of duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. I am in reference to them, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour part in reſpect of the head, and ſhoulders. And therefore if my old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſhall ſtrike at the head, or annoy the body, of which I am a foote; I ſhall kick him down, if I can, even to the ground: and ſay, there lies my old Acquaintance.</p>

It was my chance to meete him in the Kings high-way, attired like a Knight or Lord, travelling alone in a faire Coach, drawne with foure great Horſes, towards the houſe of a Lady; whoſe Prieſts have beene the pernicious cauſe of many grievous diſorders in the Countrey where I live: and this, in a moſt dangerous, and ſuſpected time.

I know, that their life, though it be mixt, hath ſo much of action in it, that they muſt alwayes bee doing. You deſire me to <hi>look back.</hi> At your entreaty, I do ſo. And looking back, I ſtill finde, that every where, there are whole ſwarmes of waſpiſh, and turbulent Papiſts. For that, which followes, <hi>God is a Father ſtill,</hi> and ſo forth: I learned all that leſſon in my converſion to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And I hope I ſhall never forget it.</p>
                        <p>You tell me, that I ſeemed to your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>a man of a good nature, and religiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</hi> Here is a plaine Jeſuiticall flattery, with a ſharpe ſting in the taile of it. Why now, you ſeeme too, ſeeme to praiſe, when you diſhonour. But how will you make it ſeeme, that I did onely ſeeme? It is very
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:152599:299"/> naturall and proper, that <hi>bonum reale,</hi> a reall good, ſhould be alſo <hi>bonum apparens,</hi> ſhould appeare to be good. For otherwiſe, it would not <hi>trahere in amorem ſui,</hi> draw men to love it. But it is an Ethicall obſervation, that men uſed to foule ſinnes, are ſo conſcious of them, and yet, ſo deſirous to diſavow them; that their guiltineſſe ſtill hammering upon their ſinnes, their obſtinacie helped with their cunning, preſently takes their tongues off from acknowledging them to bee in themſelves, and becauſe, if they be, being accidents they muſt be in convenient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, faſtens them upon others.</p>
                        <p>You <hi>remember</hi> one thing, and you <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> another. I <hi>remember</hi> likewiſe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young ſtripling, I was active in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing my ſervice upon your Church: fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with your envenomed ſuggeſtions. But give it me in a Demonſtration, at leaſt <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> that your Church is the <hi>Catholike Church, or Chriſts owne Spouſe.</hi> Your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are like your invincible Armado's, which in their firſt appearance make a mighty Moone, but are burnt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in the end, by a bold Engliſh man, or an honeſt Hollander. It is rooted in me, that there is little ſymmetry, little propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt you and the Spouſe of Chriſt. She is humble, harmeleſſe, baſhfull, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:152599:299"/> zealous of her Lords honour, and jealous of every thing which may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach or impaire it: She is filled with the holy Ghoſt, and doubtleſſe. ſpeakes all languages, when ſhe prayes; becauſe ſhee prayes in all her children with underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that ſhe may offer from the Altar of every heart, <hi>a reaſonable Sacrifice.</hi> And I doubt not, but you have your Emiſſaries, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers abroad. Certainly, had not one of the Preſſes, into which my Book unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily dropped, beene almoſt it ſelfe preſſed away, ſurcharged with your notorious and ſcurrilous Pamphlets, containing thoſe moſt horrible, and irreligious imputations of ſo many ſtrange Sects amongſt us; thoſe as falſe, as foule diſcourſes of <hi>Adamites,</hi> and the like, moving, and diſpoſing to the ruine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow, both of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, (which my experience aſſures me were yours;) and moreover, had not your humble Petition taken place in it, and wrought upon covetouſneſſe: it had beene day with my booke long agoe.</p>
                        <p>You will me to <hi>to thinke, and that without paſſion, if this be not</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. Your will is to me a law. I doe thinke, and thinke without paſſion. And now I have thought without paſſion, I have learned that indeed, this is to fight againſt God: ſtay pray, leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:152599:300"/> behinde you: if to fight againſt more then Luciferian pride, againſt Blaſphemy, againſt Idolatry, and againſt all other ſins, be to fight againſt God. Pardon me: He that railes, is unreaſonable, either in the matter of his ſpeech, or in the delivery. When I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and can make it perſpicuous to a cleare eye, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a corrupted, and putrified body; head-ſick, and heart-ſick, and therfore ill all-over: doe I fight againſt God, if I labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and keepe off the infection, <hi>ne pars ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera trahatur?</hi> Her head is ſo weake, that ſhe thinkes it ſtands as high as the clouds at leaſt, if not as high as the ſtarrie Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Her heart is not well. For, ſhe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed in that which is the very <hi>primum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> and <hi>ultimum moriens</hi> of Faith, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts merits. And therefore, her tongue ſpeakes ſtrange languages, ſhe knowes not what: Her eyes have not the gift of diſcerning aright: An Image ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to her, a little God: Her eares are out of order: they are more taken with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, then words of edification: ſhe doth not praiſe God in the <hi>muſicall inſtruments,</hi> becauſe ſhee ſtaies in the noiſe, and ends in delight: as it is in uſe with her, to ſleep, and take her nights reſt in <hi>opere operato.</hi> Onely her taſte is right, and yet, ſhe thinkes it is
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:152599:300"/> not, becauſe ſhe doth not taſte the very fleſh &amp; bloud of Chriſt. Her hands are weak; they give almes to force, and extort a reward. Her feete are worſe; they run to ſhed bloud. And is ſhe not a very ſick creature? And therefore, you may put up your dagger. For the words following, wound not: <hi>And with what weapons, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning the gifts of nature, which you call mine, improved by induſtry, &amp; the account of both: <hi>Agnoſco benefactorem,</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a heavenly Benefactour. And though no man is obliged <hi>ad optima,</hi> to the performance of the beſt things; yet, in this point, how can I better imploy the Talents with which I am intruſted, then in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Gods Church? But you come with a freſh ſupply: <hi>Can I call a Church, a thing ſo torne, and diſtracted? Can I make a belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of husks?</hi> Was not the Church gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apoſtles; vexed with clamours of people, crying, <hi>I am of Paul, and I am of Apollos?</hi> It is in the body politique, and Eccleſiaſtique, as in the naturall body. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quick, and ſudden alteration, cals up all the humours, and they being up, draw the body into parties; either pulling to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Sympathy, or putting off by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy. The water is troubled, but expect a little, and it will ſettle againe. For the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:152599:301"/> husks, I confeſſe with ſorrow of heart, there are many, and thoſe meate onely for ſwine, dull, and droſſie-headed people: as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane rudeneſſe of ſhoo-makers, Bakers, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-makers, in the ſacred houſe of God: the contempt of Divine Service, and of the Liturgy, and conſequently, of Miniſters, and their Orders: the crying down of Learning, and of the reward of it; concluſions ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and now the diſcourſe of vulgar people amongſt Chriſtians. With ſuch (I proclaime it to the world) I and my devotions ſhall have no communion; though they were able to laſh me to death with their foule tongues: but they cannot touch me with them. Theſe earthy people doe not underſtand, that <hi>minus perfectum, ad magis perfectum referri atque ordinari debet,</hi> every leſſe perfect thing ought to ſubmit, and be referred to the thing more perfect; their weake apprehenſions and erroneous conſciences, to the truth, and ſervice of God. What if the Logicians ſay, that <hi>quae ſunt eadem uni tertio, ſunt idem inter ſe;</hi> and yet, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame in Eſſence, differ in perſons? Reaſon informeth us, that as the Pope for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, or a Biſhop will reſerve caſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his owne Court, ſo God may, and muſt reſerve the knowledge of many
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:152599:301"/> things, and eſpecially of Myſteries to his owne privacie. And it is very fit we ſhould now bee ignorant of the things wee ſhall not hereafter know. And every man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding according to the capacity of his underſtanding; why ſhould not the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man ſtoope to what is ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to him with conſideration to his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance? Though ignorance hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<note place="margin">Ignorantia purae nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</note> an excuſe, obſtinacie hath never any.</p>
                        <p>And the man that hath but ſipped of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh experience, will eaſily beleeve, that a Papiſt was the malignant contriver of that ſwelling and wordy, but chaffie, ſenſeleſſe, and empty Pamphlet; ballaſſed with the name of, <hi>A true Relation of a combuſtion, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Saint</hi> Annes <hi>Church by Alderſgate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a ſtranger, ſometimes a Jeſuit, but now thankes be to God, reformed to our Church, and one</hi> Marler <hi>a Button-maker, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein the Author of the <hi>true Relation,</hi> hath ſcarce a true word, to beare witneſſe, that he knowes what is truth. And if there be a true word in all the Pamphlet; it is that onely, <hi>reformed to the Church of England.</hi> For, neither was the Preacher a Button-maker, but a Divine; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did we joyne any kinde of diſcourſe; neither came I neere the Pulpit, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Miniſter, and Veſtry-men.</p>
                        <p>Your prayer in the end, is charitable on
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:152599:302"/> your part: which, with your leave, I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of you, and turne upon you againe? But whereas you conclude all with: <hi>which he prayes day and night, that loves you night and day:</hi> it had beene a truth of truths, if it had run thus: <hi>which he prayes day and night, that loves night more then day.</hi>
